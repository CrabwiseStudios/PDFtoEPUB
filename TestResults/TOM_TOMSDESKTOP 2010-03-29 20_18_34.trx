&lt;A name=18&gt;&lt;/a&gt;       &lt;b&gt;4 B's Restaurant Tomato Soup&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;      Yield: 8 Servings&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;      1 cn 28 0z tomatoes,Diced&lt;br&gt;      1 c  chicken broth&lt;br&gt;    1/4 c  butter&lt;br&gt;      2 T  sugar&lt;br&gt;      1 T  onion,Chopped&lt;br&gt;    1/8 t  baking soda&lt;br&gt;      2 c  milk&lt;br&gt;
In a saucepan, combine the first 6 ingredients.  Cover and simmer&lt;br&gt;for 1 hour.  Heat milk, add to tomato mixture just before serving.  Makes&lt;br&gt;about 1 1/2    quarts.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;A name=19&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;       7-Eleven Cherry Slurpee&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;      Yield: 1 Servings&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;      2 c  cold club soda&lt;br&gt;    1/2 c  sugar&lt;br&gt;    1/4 t  cherry kool-aid mix&lt;br&gt;           -unsweetened,plus 1/8 tsp&lt;br&gt;    1/2 t  cherry extract&lt;br&gt;  2 1/2 c  ice,Crushed&lt;br&gt;
1. Pour 1 cup of the club soda into a blender. Add the sugar,  Kool-Aid&lt;br&gt;mix, and cherry extract. Blend this until all of the  sugar is&lt;br&gt;dissolved.&lt;br&gt;2. Add the crushed ice and blend on high speed until the  drink is a&lt;br&gt;slushy, smooth consistency, with no remaining  chunks of ice.&lt;br&gt;3. Add the remaining club soda and blend briefly until  mixed. You may&lt;br&gt;have to stop the blender and use a long  spoon to stir up the contents.&lt;br&gt;4. If necessary, put the blender into your freezer for  1/2-hour. This&lt;br&gt;will help thicken it up. After 1/2-hour  remove blender from freezer and,&lt;br&gt;again, blend briefly  to mix.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;A name=20&gt;&lt;/a&gt;       &lt;b&gt;7-Up Bread&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;      Yield: 1 Servings&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;      1 c  7-up&lt;br&gt;      1    egg&lt;br&gt;      1 T  vanilla (or any extract or&lt;br&gt;           -liquid f,lavoring you wish&lt;br&gt;      1 ds nutmeg&lt;br&gt;      3 c  bisquick&lt;br&gt;
In 1 1/2 quart mixing bowl, using wire whisk or mixing spoon, beat&lt;br&gt;7-Up with egg and vanilla (or extract/flavoring of your choice) and&lt;br&gt;beat in nutmeg (or any other powdered spice) to taste, till&lt;br&gt;thoroughly combined. Dump in the Bisquick.  Stir to mix well, but do&lt;br&gt;NOT overbeat or bread will be heavy!  Batter will be lumpy -- but al&lt;br&gt;dry particles well moistened by liquid ingredients.  Scrape batter&lt;br&gt;down into Pam sprayed 8&amp;quot; Pyrex loaf dish.&lt;br&gt;
Let stand 10 minutes to &amp;quot;proof&amp;quot; (give batter chance to rise a bit)&lt;br&gt;and bake in preheated 400 degree F oven 50 to 55 minutes -- or till&lt;br&gt;tests done. Best way to test it for doneness is to insert a&lt;br&gt;paper-covered wire trash bag &amp;quot;twist&amp;quot; through center of bread till it&lt;br&gt;touches the bottom of dish. When it come out clean of any wet batter,&lt;br&gt;remove to wire rack to cool 1 hour.&lt;br&gt;
Remove from baking dish &amp;amp; allow bread to cool another 3 hours before&lt;br&gt;attempting to slice it.  Store in plastic bags at room temperature to&lt;br&gt;use within 3 days.  Freeze bread to use within 3 months -- slicing it&lt;br&gt;before you freeze it, though.&lt;br&gt;
VARIATION:  Using Vernor's Gingerale in place of the 7-Up worked&lt;br&gt;every bit as well as with the 7-Up.  Follow recipe exactly as given&lt;br&gt;above, but you may use pumpking pie spice in place of nutmeg and&lt;br&gt;lemon extract instead of vanilla when you use the gingerale.  Or use&lt;br&gt;Squirt.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;A name=21&gt;&lt;/a&gt;     &lt;b&gt;  7-Up Drop Biscuits&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;      Yield: 7 Servings&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;      2 c  bisquick mix&lt;br&gt;    2/3 c  7-up&lt;br&gt;
Mix together with rubber bowl scraper until thick, sticky and moist.&lt;br&gt;Grease a 9&amp;quot; round layer cake pan or spray in Pam and drop dough into&lt;br&gt;pan by tablespoonful, making 7 portions -- one in the center &amp;amp; 6&lt;br&gt;other portions equally spaced around that.  Bake at 400 degrees F for&lt;br&gt;24 minutes or till golden brown.  Serve warm, splitting each biscuit&lt;br&gt;with your thumbs, rather than cutting them in half.&lt;br&gt;
Makes 7 large biscuits.&lt;br&gt;

Dissolve the sugar in the hot water.  Add the root beer concentrate&lt;br&gt;and let cool.  Combine the root beer mixture with the cold seltzer&lt;br&gt;water, drink immediately or store in refrigerator in tightly covered&lt;br&gt;container. Makes 5 cups.&lt;br&gt;

1. Add 3 tablespoons oil to a large soup pot or saucepan over&lt;br&gt;medium/high heat. Add the sliced onions and saute for 20 minutes until the&lt;br&gt;onions begin to soften and start to become translucent. You don't want them to&lt;br&gt;brown.&lt;br&gt;
2. Add the beef broth, water, salt, garlic powder and black pepper to&lt;br&gt;the pan and bring mixture to a boil. When soup begins to boil, reduce heat&lt;br&gt;and simmer for 45 minutes. &lt;br&gt;
3. To make the croutons cut off the top half of each top of the hamburger bun so&lt;br&gt;that the bread is the same thickness as the bottom half of each bun. Throw the&lt;br&gt;tops away. Now you should have 10 round pieces of bread -- 5 bottom buns, and&lt;br&gt;5 top buns with the tops cut off. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Place the bread in&lt;br&gt;the oven directly on the rack and bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until each piece is&lt;br&gt;golden brown and crispy. Set these croutons aside until you need them. &lt;br&gt;
4. When the soup is done, spoon about 1 cup into an oven-safe bowl. Float a&lt;br&gt;crouton on top of the soup, then place a slice of provolone cheese on top of the&lt;br&gt;crouton. Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon of shredded parmesan cheese over the&lt;br&gt;provolone. &lt;br&gt;
5. Place the bowl into your oven set to high broil. Broil the soup for 5&lt;br&gt;to 6 minutes or until the cheese is melted and starting to brown (you may&lt;br&gt;need to broil longer if you are making more than one bowl at a time).&lt;br&gt;Sprinkle an additional 1/2 teaspoon of shredded parmesan cheese over the top&lt;br&gt;of the soup and serve. Repeat process to prepare remaining servings.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Makes 10 servings.&lt;br&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

    1/4 c  Grey Poupon Dijon mustard&lt;br&gt;
      3 T  lime juice&lt;br&gt;
    1/4 c  honey&lt;br&gt;
      2 T  soy sauce&lt;br&gt;
      1 T  prepared mustard&lt;br&gt;
    1/2 T  Worcestershire&lt;br&gt;
      1 T  white vinegar&lt;br&gt;

    1/2 t  cayenne pepper&lt;br&gt;
      1 lg tomato,diced&lt;br&gt;
    1/2 t  white pepper&lt;br&gt;
      1    hardboiled egg white,diced&lt;br&gt;
  **other**&lt;br&gt;      2    boneless,skinless chicken breast halves&lt;br&gt;      2 T  light butter&lt;br&gt;
                 &lt;br&gt;
1.  Make dressing by combining ingredients in a small bowl.  Mix wel  by hand.  Store in&lt;br&gt;a covered container in the refrigerator until salad is ready.  &lt;br&gt;
2.  Combine water, lime juice, soy sauce, and Worcestershire in a medium bowl, and&lt;br&gt;stir.  Add the chicken breasts to the marinade, cover bowl and keep in refrigerator for&lt;br&gt;several hours.  Overnight is even better.&lt;br&gt;
3. When chicken is marinated, preheat a frying pan or skillet (an iron skil et, if you've got&lt;br&gt;it) over medium/high heat.  Also, preheat your barbecue grill to medium/high heat.  &lt;br&gt;
4.  Combine the spices for the Cajun spice blend in a small bowl.  Sprinkle a teaspoon&lt;br&gt;of the spice blend over one side of each of the chicken breasts.  Cover the entire&lt;br&gt;surface of the chicken with spice.  &lt;br&gt;
5.  Melt the butter in the hot pan, then sear the chicken breasts for 2-3 minutes on the&lt;br&gt;side with the spices.  While first side cooks, sprinkle another teaspoon of spice over the&lt;br&gt;top of each chicken breast, coating that side as you did the other.  Flip the chicken over,&lt;br&gt;and sear for another 2-3 minutes.  The surface of the chicken wil  be coated with a&lt;br&gt;charred, black layer of flavor.  This is exactly what you are shooting for.  &lt;br&gt;
6.  Finish the chicken off on your barbecue grill. Grill each breast on both sides for 2-3&lt;br&gt;minutes, or until they are done.  &lt;br&gt;
7. While chicken is cooking prepare the salads by splitting the lettuce into two large&lt;br&gt;bowls.  Toss in the red cabbage and carrots.  Mix the cheeses together, then top the&lt;br&gt;salad with the cheeses and hard boiled egg. Sprinkle the diced tomato on each salad.&lt;br&gt;
 8.  Slice the chicken breast, across each breast in 1/2-inch-thick slices.  Spread the&lt;br&gt;chicken over the top of the salad and serve immediately with dressing on the side.&lt;br&gt;
Serves 2 as an entree.&lt;br&gt;

Preheat the oil in a deep fryer&lt;br&gt;or frying pan over medium heat to 350.  Oil needs to be at least 1/2&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;deep.  In a small, shallow bowl beat the egg, add the milk and mix&lt;br&gt;well.  In another bowl, combine the flour with the cornflake crumbs,&lt;br&gt;salt and pepper.  Cut the chicken breast into 4 to 5 long strips.&lt;br&gt;Dip each strip into the egg mixture then into the flour mixture,&lt;br&gt;coating each piece completely.  Fry each chicken finger for 5 minutes&lt;br&gt;or until the coating has darkened to brown.  Prepare the salad by&lt;br&gt;tossing the romaine with the red cabbage, napa cabbage and carrot.&lt;br&gt;Sprinkle the green onion on top of the lettuce mixture.  Sprinkle the&lt;br&gt;almonds over the salad, then the chow mein noodles. Cut the chicken&lt;br&gt;into bite-size chunks.  Place the chicken on the salad, forming a&lt;br&gt;pile in the middle.  Serve with salad dressing on the side.&lt;br&gt;

      2 c  crumbled corn chips or,(see&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
tidbits) fried tortilla strips&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;br&gt;1. Prepare marinade by combining marinade ingredients in a medium bowl. Add&lt;br&gt;the chicken to the bowl, cover and chill for 2 to 3 hours. &lt;br&gt;2. Make the mexi-ranch dressing by combining all of the ingredients in a medium&lt;br&gt;bowl. Mix well until smooth, then cover dressing and chill it until needed. &lt;br&gt;3. When you are ready to prepare the entree, preheat the oven to high broil.&lt;br&gt;Also, preheat your barbecue or indoor grill to high heat. When the grill is hot&lt;br&gt;cook the marinated chicken breasts for 3 to 5 minutes per side, or until they're&lt;br&gt;done. &lt;br&gt;4. Arrange the cooked chicken in a baking pan. Spread a layer of mexi-ranch&lt;br&gt;dressing over each piece of chicken (you'll have plenty left over), followed by 1/4&lt;br&gt;cup of the shredded cheese blend. Broil the chicken for 2 to 3 minutes, or just&lt;br&gt;until the cheese has melted. &lt;br&gt;5. Spread a bed of 1/2 cup of the tortilla strips or crumbled corn chips on each of&lt;br&gt;four plates. Slide a chicken breast onto the chips on each plate and serve with&lt;br&gt;your choice of rice, and pico de gallo, or salsa.  Serves 4.&lt;br&gt;
Tidbits: Crumbling store-bought tortilla chips is the easy way to make the bed of&lt;br&gt;crunchy chips that the tequila lime chicken rests on. But, you can make tortilla&lt;br&gt;strips like those served at the restaurant by cutting a stack of eight 6-inch corn&lt;br&gt;tortillas in half. Stack the halves on top of each other and slice the tortillas into&lt;br&gt;thin strips. Fry the tortilla strips in 2 cups of oil preheated in a large skillet for 3-5&lt;br&gt;minutes or until crispy. Salt lightly and cool on paper towels to drain.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;A name=47&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;b&gt;   Auntie Anne's Pretzels&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  1 1/4 c  water,Warm&lt;br&gt;      1 T  plus 1/4 teaspoon yeast&lt;br&gt;  3 3/4 c  al -purpose flour&lt;br&gt;    3/4 c  plus 2 tablespoons powdered&lt;br&gt;           -sugar&lt;br&gt;  1 1/2 t  salt&lt;br&gt;      2 t  vegetable oil&lt;br&gt;  Bath  ===========================&lt;br&gt;      4 c  water,Warm&lt;br&gt;    1/2 c  baking soda&lt;br&gt;  Other  ==========================&lt;br&gt;    1/4 c  butter,melted&lt;br&gt;           kosher (or pretzel salt)&lt;br&gt;  Cinnamon Topping  ===============&lt;br&gt;    1/2 c  granulated sugar&lt;br&gt;      2 t  cinnamon&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;. Dissolve the yeast in the warm water in a small bowl or cup. Let it sit for a few&lt;br&gt;minutes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;. Combine flour, powdered sugar and salt in a large mixing bowl. Add water with yeast&lt;br&gt;and vegetable oil. Stir with a spoon and then use your hands to form the dough into a&lt;br&gt;ball. Knead the dough for 5 minutes on a lightly floured surface. Dough wil  be nice and&lt;br&gt;smooth when it's ready. Place the dough into a lightly oiled bowl, cover it and, and store&lt;br&gt;it in a warm place for about 45 minutes or until the dough doubles in size.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;. When dough has risen, preheat oven to 425 degrees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;. Make a bath for the pretzels by combining the baking soda with the warm water and&lt;br&gt;stir until baking soda is mostly dissolved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;5.&lt;/b&gt; Remove the dough from the bowl and divide it into 8 even portions. Roll each portion&lt;br&gt;on a flat non-floured surface until it is about 3 feet long. Pick up both ends of the dough&lt;br&gt;and give it a little spin so the middle&lt;br&gt;of the dough spins around once. Lay the dough down with the loop nearest to you. Fold&lt;br&gt;the ends down toward you and pinch to attach them to the bottom of the loop. The twist&lt;br&gt;should be in the middle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;. Holding the pinched ends, dip each pretzel into the bath solution. Put each pretzel on&lt;br&gt;a paper towel for a moment to blot the excess liquid. Arrange the pretzels on a baking&lt;br&gt;sheet sprayed with non-stick spray. If you want salt, sprinkle pretzels with kosher or&lt;br&gt;pretzel salt. Don't salt any pretzels you plan to coat with cinnamon/sugar. You wil  likely&lt;br&gt;have to use two baking sheets, and be sure to bake them separately. Bake the the&lt;br&gt;pretzels for 4 minutes, then spin the pan halfway around and bake for another 4 to 5&lt;br&gt;minutes or until the pretzels are golden brown.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt;. Remove the pretzels from the oven, and let them cool for a couple minutes. If you&lt;br&gt;want to eat some now, brush 'em with melted butter first, if desired, before serving. If&lt;br&gt;you want the cinnamon/sugar coating make it by combining the 1/2 cup sugar and 2&lt;br&gt;teaspoons cinnamon in a small bowl. Brush the unsalted pretzels you plan to coat with a&lt;br&gt;generous amount of melted butter. Sprinkle a heavy coating of the cinnamon/sugar onto&lt;br&gt;the entire surface of the pretzels over a plate. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;A name=48&gt;&lt;/a&gt;      &lt;b&gt; Baby Ruth Candy Bar (Nestle)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
   &lt;br&gt;
 **Centers**&lt;br&gt;
           **Outside**&lt;br&gt;
    1/4 c  whole milk&lt;br&gt;
     20    unwrapped caramels&lt;br&gt;
      5    unwrapped caramels&lt;br&gt;
  1 1/2 t  water&lt;br&gt;
      1 T  light corn syrup&lt;br&gt;
      2 c  dry roasted peanuts&lt;br&gt;
      1 t  butter&lt;br&gt;
      1    12-ounce bag milk chocolate-chips&lt;br&gt;
    1/4 t  vanil a&lt;br&gt;    1/8 t  salt&lt;br&gt;  1 1/4 c  powdered sugar&lt;br&gt;
      &lt;br&gt;1. Combine all ingredients for the centers, except the powdered&lt;br&gt;sugar, in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir often as the caramel slowly melts.&lt;br&gt;When the mixture is smooth, add 3/4 cup of powdered sugar. Stir. Save the&lt;br&gt;remaining 1/2 cup of powdered sugar for later.&lt;br&gt;2. Use a candy thermometer to bring the mixture to exactly 230 degrees, stirring often,&lt;br&gt;then turn off the heat. &lt;br&gt;3. When the temperature of the candy begins to drop, add the remaining 1/2 cup&lt;br&gt;powdered sugar to the pan, then use a hand mixer on high speed to combine. Keep&lt;br&gt;mixing until the candy cools and thickens and can no longer be mixed. That should take&lt;br&gt;a minute or two. &lt;br&gt;4. Let the candy cool in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes, or until it can be touched. Don't let&lt;br&gt;it sit too long -- you want the candy to still be warm and pliable when&lt;br&gt;you shape it. Take a tablespoon-size portion and roll it between your palms&lt;br&gt;or on a counter top until it forms a roll with the width of your index&lt;br&gt;finger, and measuring about 4 1/2-inches long. Repeat with the remaining center&lt;br&gt;candy mixture and place the rolls on wax paper. You should have 8 rolls. Let the center&lt;br&gt;rol s sit out for an hour or two to firm up. &lt;br&gt;5. Combine the 20 caramels with the 1 1/2 teaspoons of water in a small saucepan over&lt;br&gt;low heat. Stir often until the caramels melt completely, then turn off the heat. If you work&lt;br&gt;fast this caramel wil  stay warm while you make the&lt;br&gt;candy bars. &lt;br&gt;6. Pour the peanuts onto a baking sheet or other flat surface. Using a basting brush and&lt;br&gt;working quickly, &amp;quot;paint&amp;quot; a coating of caramel onto one side of a center roll. Quickly turn&lt;br&gt;the center over, caramel-side-down, onto the peanuts and press gently so that the&lt;br&gt;peanuts stick to the surface of the candy. Paint more caramel onto the other side of the&lt;br&gt;rol  and press it down onto the peanuts. The candy should have a solid layer of peanuts&lt;br&gt;covering all sides. If needed, brush additional caramel onto the roll, then turn it onto the&lt;br&gt;peanuts to coat the roll completely. Place the candy bar onto wax paper, and repeat with&lt;br&gt;the remaining ingredients. Place these bars into your refrigerator for an hour or two so&lt;br&gt;that they firm up. &lt;br&gt;7. Pour the milk chocolate chips into a glass or ceramic bowl and zap it in the&lt;br&gt;microwave for 2 minutes on 50% power. Gently stir the chips, then heat for an additional&lt;br&gt;30 seconds at 50% power. Repeat if necessary, stirring gently after each 30 seconds.&lt;br&gt;Don't over cook the chips or the chocolate wil  burn and seize up on you. &lt;br&gt;8. Drop a candy bar center into the melted milk chocolate. Cover the candy bar with&lt;br&gt;chocolate using two forks, one in each hand. When the candy is covered with chocolate,&lt;br&gt;balance the bar on both of the forks, one at each end of the candy bar, and tap the forks&lt;br&gt;on the top edge of the bowl so that much of the chocolate drops off.

1. Make your cake fol owing the directions on the box. If you are making the&lt;br&gt;white cake you will likely blend the cake mix with water, oil and 3 eggs. Pour the&lt;br&gt;batter into a greased 9x13-inch baking pan and bake at 350 degrees for 30 to 35&lt;br&gt;minutes. When cake is done, let it cool to room temperature.&lt;br&gt;2. When the cake has cooled, slice it in half and place each half on a wax-paper&lt;br&gt;covered cookie sheet, or a platter or tray that will fit into your freezer.&lt;br&gt;3. Use a sharp serrated knife (a bread knife works great) to slice the ice cream&lt;br&gt;through the middle, box and all, so that you have two 2-inch thick sheets of ice&lt;br&gt;cream. Peel the cardboard off the ice cream and lay a half upon each of cakes.&lt;br&gt;Slice the edges of the cake al  the way around so that the cake is the same size&lt;br&gt;as the ice cream on top. Work quickly so that the ice cream doesn't melt. When&lt;br&gt;both cake have been trimmed, place them into the freezer for an hour or two.&lt;br&gt;4. When you are ready to frost the cake, take the two pints (4 cups) of vanilla ice&lt;br&gt;cream out of the freezer for 20 to 30 minutes to soften. Stir the ice cream so that&lt;br&gt;it is smooth, like frosting. Use a frosting knife or spatula to coat each cake with&lt;br&gt;about 2 cups of ice cream. Cover the entire surface thoroughly so that you&lt;br&gt;cannot see any of the cake. Pop the cakes into the freezer for an hour or so to&lt;br&gt;set up.&lt;br&gt;5. When the cakes have set, fill a pastry bag (with a fancy tip) with white frosting&lt;br&gt;to decorate al  around the top edge of the cake. Also decorate around the bottom&lt;br&gt;of the cake. Use colored frosting and different tips to add inspired artistic flair&lt;br&gt;and writing on the cake, as needed. Cover the cakes and keep them in your&lt;br&gt;freezer until party time.&lt;br&gt;6. When you are ready to serve the cakes, leave them out for 10 to 15 minutes&lt;br&gt;before slicing. Cut the cakes with a sharp knife that has been held under hot&lt;br&gt;water.&lt;br&gt;

Cut them in slices 1 cm (3/8&amp;quot;) thick&lt;br&gt;and finally cut them into fries of 1 cm square. Dry the fries well in&lt;br&gt;paper or a towel before putting them into the oil.&lt;br&gt;
Heat the oil in a hot frying pan or deep fryer to a temperature of&lt;br&gt;160C (320F). Put in a hand full of fries: not more at once because the&lt;br&gt;oil will cool down too much. Fry for a few minutes (4-8 depending on&lt;br&gt;the thickness and the kind of potatoes), stir.&lt;br&gt;
Finally heat to 190C (375F) and fry for 2 minutes until crispy and&lt;br&gt;golden brown. This way the fries will be crispy on the outside and&lt;br&gt;soft on the inside, the way they should be.&lt;br&gt;

Cut the&lt;br&gt;thin, pointed end off the breast.  Pound on the chicken with a&lt;br&gt;meat-tenderizing mal et to flatten the breast and shaep it to fit&lt;br&gt;better on the bun.  Dip the chicken in milk , then in the flour,&lt;br&gt;being sure to coat the entire surface fo the chicken. Take the coated&lt;br&gt;chicken breast and repeat the process.  Let the chicken sit in the&lt;br&gt;refrigerator for 10 to 15 minutes.&lt;br&gt;
Drop the chicken breast into the hot oil and fry for 10 minutes or&lt;br&gt;until the outside becomes golden brown.  Drain on paper towels.  As&lt;br&gt;the chicken is frying, toast or grill the face of the hamburger bun&lt;br&gt;until light brown. Tha sandwich is served open face, so place the bun&lt;br&gt;face up on the plate. On the face of the top bun place the leaf of&lt;br&gt;lettuce.  On the lettuce stack two slices of tomato. Separate the&lt;br&gt;slice of red onion and places 2 to 3 rings of onion on the tomato&lt;br&gt;slices. When the chicken breast has cooked and drained, place it in a&lt;br&gt;plastic container that has a lid.  Pour the hot sauce into the&lt;br&gt;container, put the lid on top, and shake gently to coat the chicken&lt;br&gt;with hot sauce.  Be sure to shake only enough to coat the chicken.&lt;br&gt;If you shake too hard, the crispy coating will fall off the chicken.&lt;br&gt;Stack the chicken breast on the bottom half of the hamburger bun and&lt;br&gt;place it on the plate beside the top half of the sandwich.  Serve&lt;br&gt;open face, with bleu cheese dressing on the side.&lt;br&gt;

Combine chicken stock in sauce pan with ham base.&lt;br&gt;
Stir until lumps are gone. In separate stock pot: melt first margarine&lt;br&gt;measurement; add onion and sautee until transparent. Add potato bite size&lt;br&gt;pieces and pepper.&lt;br&gt;
Add chicken stock mix and stir until well mixed. Bring mixture to a boil. In small&lt;br&gt;pan, melt second margarine measure and add flour to create a roux. It should be&lt;br&gt;light brown in color. &lt;br&gt;
When stock comes to a boil, add roux with a wire whisk.  This will cause the&lt;br&gt;soup to start thickening. Return to a boil. Slowly add the milk. If the soup is too&lt;br&gt;thin, make additional roux and add it to the soup.&lt;br&gt;
If you need to do this, be sure to cook the roux until a tan color.  This will get rid&lt;br&gt;of the raw flour taste. If the soup is too thick, thin it out with more milk.&lt;br&gt;

1.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  &lt;br&gt;2.  Combine the tomato sauce, barbecue sauce and sugar in a small saucepan&lt;br&gt;over medium heat.  Heat the mixture until it begins to bubble, stirring often, then&lt;br&gt;remove it from the heat.&lt;br&gt;3.  In a large bowl, add all but 2 tablespoons of the tomato sauce to the meat.&lt;br&gt;Use a large wooden spoon or your hands to work the sauce into the meat until it&lt;br&gt;is very well combined.  &lt;br&gt;4.  Combine the remaining ingredients with the ground sirloin-- flour, salt, onion&lt;br&gt;powder and ground pepper. Use the wooden spoon or your hands to work the&lt;br&gt;spices and flour into the meat.  &lt;br&gt;5.  Load the meat into a loaf pan (preferably a meatloaf pan with two sections&lt;br&gt;which allows the fat to drain, but if you don't have one of those a regular loaf pan&lt;br&gt;will work).  Wrap foil over the pan and place it into the oven for 30 minutes.  &lt;br&gt;6.  After 30 minutes, take the meatloaf from the oven, remove the foil and, if you&lt;br&gt;aren't using a meatloaf pan, drain the fat.  &lt;br&gt;7.  Using a knife, slice the meatloaf all the way through into 8 slices while it is still&lt;br&gt;in the pan.  This will help to cook the center of the meatloaf.  Pour the remaining&lt;br&gt;2 tablespoons of sauce over the top of the meatloaf, in a stream down the&lt;br&gt;center.  Don't spread the sauce.  &lt;br&gt;8. Place the meatloaf back into the oven, uncovered, for 25-30 minutes or until it&lt;br&gt;is done.  Remove and allow it to cool for a few minutes before serving.   &lt;br&gt;

1.  Prepare the spread by combining the ingredients in a smal  bowl.&lt;br&gt;Set this aside until you are ready to use it.  &lt;br&gt;2.  Preheat your barbecue or indoor grill to high heat.  &lt;br&gt;3.  Divide the ground beef into 8 even portions (3 ounces each).  Roll each&lt;br&gt;portion into a ball, then press each ball flat to form a patty about the same&lt;br&gt;diameter as the bun.  &lt;br&gt;4.  Grill the beef patties for 2-3 minutes per side, or until done.  Lightly salt and&lt;br&gt;pepper each side of the patties.  &lt;br&gt;5.  As the meat cooks, brown the faces of the buns in a hot skillet, toaster oven&lt;br&gt;or face-down on the grill.  Watch the buns closely so that they do not burn.  &lt;br&gt;6.  Build each burger by first spreading a tablespoon of the spread on the face of&lt;br&gt;the top bun. Arrange about 1/3 cup of lettuce evenly over the spread. &lt;br&gt;7.  On the bottom bun stack a patty, then a slice of American cheese, another&lt;br&gt;patty, and another slice of cheese.  &lt;br&gt;8.  On the top slice of cheese arrange 2-3 separated onion slices (rings), then 2&lt;br&gt;pickle slices.  &lt;br&gt;9.  Turn the top part of the burger over onto the bottom and serve.  You may also&lt;br&gt;want to zap the sandwiches in the microwave, individually, for 15-20 seconds&lt;br&gt;each. Serves 4.  &lt;br&gt;

1.  Prepare biscuits following instructions on the can (350 degrees&lt;br&gt;for 15-18 min.).  When you remove the biscuits from the oven brush the top&lt;br&gt;of each with melted butter.  &lt;br&gt;2.  Spray a skillet over medium heat with non-stick cooking spray.  Open both&lt;br&gt;ends of a clean, small sliced pineapple can.  Spray the inside of the empty can&lt;br&gt;with the non-stick spray, and then place the can in the pan to heat up.  Use more&lt;br&gt;than one can if you'd like to speed up the cooking process.  &lt;br&gt;3.  Beat an egg, then pour it into the empty can mold, add a bit of salt and&lt;br&gt;pepper, and cover with a saucepan lid.  Cook for a couple minutes, then scrape&lt;br&gt;a knife around the edge of the egg to release it.  Remove the can then turn the&lt;br&gt;egg over and cook it for another minute or two.  Repeat with the remaining eggs.&lt;br&gt;4.  If using sausage, form 2-ounce portions of sausage into patties with the same&lt;br&gt;diameter as the biscuits.  Cook the sausage in another hot skillet over medium&lt;br&gt;heat until brown.  If using bacon, cook the bacon and drain on paper towels.  &lt;br&gt;5.  Slice a biscuit in half through the middle.  Build each sandwich by first&lt;br&gt;stacking egg on the bottom half of the biscuit.  Next arrange sausage (or 2 slices&lt;br&gt;of bacon) on the egg, then a slice of American cheese.  Top off each sandwich&lt;br&gt;with the top biscuit half, then zap it in the microwave for 15-20 seconds to help&lt;br&gt;melt the cheese.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients.   &lt;br&gt;

1.  Rinse and drain the split peas, then add them to a large pot&lt;br&gt;with 6 cups of water, chicken broth, onion, garlic, lemon juice, salt, sugar,&lt;br&gt;parsley, pepper, and thyme.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and&lt;br&gt;simmer for 75 minutes or until the peas are soft.  &lt;br&gt;
2.  While the peas are cooking, combine the barley with 6 cups of water in a&lt;br&gt;saucepan.  Bring to a boil,  then reduce heat and simmer for 75 minutes or until&lt;br&gt;the barley is soft and most of the water has been absorbed.  &lt;br&gt;
3.  When the split pea mixture has become a thick soup, use a hand held&lt;br&gt;blender to puree the peas until the mixture is smooth.  You may also use a&lt;br&gt;standard blender or food processor for this step, pureeing the soup in batches.&lt;br&gt;Alternately, if you like, you may skip this step, keeping the soup rather chunky.&lt;br&gt;It's still good this way, just not as smooth as the real thing.  &lt;br&gt;
4.  Drain the barley mixture in a sieve or colander and add it to the split pea&lt;br&gt;mixture.  Add the carrots and celery and continue to simmer the soup for 15 to&lt;br&gt;30 minutes or until the carrots are tender.  Stir occasionally.  Turn off the heat,&lt;br&gt;cover the soup, and let it sit for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.  Garnish each&lt;br&gt;serving with a little chopped green onion.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;A name=130&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;b&gt;   Chevy's Fresh Salsa&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;      Yield: 1 Servings&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;      6 md tomatoes&lt;br&gt;     10    jalapenos,(red is best)&lt;br&gt;    1/4    a medium Spanish onion&lt;br&gt;      2    cloves garlic&lt;br&gt;      2 T  fresh cilantro,Chopped&lt;br&gt;      2 T  white vinegar&lt;br&gt;      2 t  salt&lt;br&gt;  1 1/2 t  mesquite-flavored liquid&lt;br&gt;           -smoke&lt;br&gt;
1.  Preheat your barbecue grill to high temperature.  &lt;br&gt;2.  Remove any stems from the tomatoes, then rub some oil over each tomato.&lt;br&gt;You can leave the stems on the jalapenos.  &lt;br&gt;3.  Place the tomatoes on the grill when it's hot. After about 10 minutes, place all&lt;br&gt;of the jalapenos onto the grill.  In about 10 minutes you can turn the tomatoes&lt;br&gt;and the peppers.  When almost the entire surface of the peppers has charred&lt;br&gt;black you can remove them from the grill.  The tomatoes will turn partially black,&lt;br&gt;but when the skin begins to come off they are done.  Put the peppers and&lt;br&gt;tomatoes on a plate and let them cool.  &lt;br&gt;4.  When the tomatoes and peppers have cooled, remove most of the skin from&lt;br&gt;the tomatoes and place them into a food processor.  Pinch the stem end from&lt;br&gt;each of the peppers and place them into the food processor as well.  Toss out&lt;br&gt;the liquid that remains on the plate.  &lt;br&gt;5. Add the remaining ingredients to the food processor and puree on high speed&lt;br&gt;for 5-10 seconds or until the mixture has a smooth consistency.  &lt;br&gt;6. Place the salsa into a covered container and chill for several hours or&lt;br&gt;overnight while the flavors develop.   Makes approximately 2 cups.&lt;br&gt;

Cool.  &lt;br&gt;3.  Mash potatoes and remove about half of the skin.  You want to leave the rest&lt;br&gt;in.  &lt;br&gt;4.  Melt the butter in a large suacepan over medium heat, then add garlic and&lt;br&gt;saute for 5 minutes.  &lt;br&gt;5.

1.  Prepare the marinade by combining the ingredients in a medium bowl. Add chicken&lt;br&gt;breast fillet to the bowl, cover, and chill for one hour.&lt;br&gt;2. When the chicken is finished marinating, preheat your grill to high temperature.  &lt;br&gt;3.  As grill is heating, prepare the spicy BBQ sauce by mixing the ingredients in a smal&lt;br&gt;bowl.  &lt;br&gt;4.  Throw the chicken on the grill and cook it for 4 to 5 minutes per side or until it's done.&lt;br&gt;When the chicken is done cooking, chop it into bite-size pieces.  &lt;br&gt;5.  Spray a light coating of nonstick cooking spray on a medium skillet over medium&lt;br&gt;heat. Saut the sliced peppers and onion in the pan for 4 to 5 minutes or&lt;br&gt;until the veggies start to brown.  &lt;br&gt;6.  Set a large skillet over medium/low heat.&lt;br&gt;7.  Put one flour tortilla in the skillet and sprinkle 1/3 cup of cheese over half of the&lt;br&gt;tortilla.  Spoon half of the vegetables over the cheese, followed by half of the chicken.  &lt;br&gt;8.  Spoon a generous portion of the spicy BBQ sauce over the chicken, followed by&lt;br&gt;another 1/3 cup of cheese.  &lt;br&gt;9. Fold the other side of the tortil a over the filling, and press down so that it stays in&lt;br&gt;place.  &lt;br&gt;10.  By this time, the cheese on the bottom should be melted.  If not, wait another&lt;br&gt;minute or so, then flip the quesadilla over and heat for another couple minutes or until all&lt;br&gt;of the cheese has melted.  &lt;br&gt;11.  Slide the quesadil a onto a plate and slice it into 4 pieces. Repeat for the second&lt;br&gt;quesadil a and serve immediately with salsa on the side.  &lt;br&gt;Serves 4 as an appetizer.&lt;br&gt;

1/2 c  vegetable oil&lt;br&gt;2    6-inch&lt;br&gt;1/2 ts ground cinnamon&lt;br&gt;2 TB sugar&lt;br&gt;1/4 c  cornflake crumbs&lt;br&gt;2 lg scoops  vanilla ice cream&lt;br&gt;1 cn whipped cream&lt;br&gt;2    maraschino cherries with&lt;br&gt;:          stems&lt;br&gt;:          flour tortilla&lt;br&gt;
Prepare each tortilla  by frying it in the hot oil in a frying pan&lt;br&gt;over medium/high heat.  Fry each side of the tortilla for about 1&lt;br&gt;minute until crispy.  Drain the tortillas on paper towels. Combine&lt;br&gt;the cinnamon and sugar in a small bowl. Sprinkle half of the cinnamon&lt;br&gt;mixture over both sides of the fried tortillas, coating evenly. Not&lt;br&gt;all of the sugar mixture will stick to the tortillas, and that's&lt;br&gt;okay. Combine the other half of the cinnamon mixture with the&lt;br&gt;cornflake crumbs in another small bowl. Pour the cornflake mixture&lt;br&gt;into a wide, shallow bowl or onto a plate. Place a large scoop of ice&lt;br&gt;cream in the cornflake crumbs, and with your hands roll the ice cream&lt;br&gt;around until the entire surface is evenly coated with cornflake&lt;br&gt;crumbs.

&lt;A name=140&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;       Chicken Taquito Ideas&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;      Yield: 1 Servings&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Boil boneless, skinless chicken breasts in water with salt, pepper,&lt;br&gt;garlic, slices of onion and celery tops until cooked. Remove chicken and remove&lt;br&gt;fat, etc and tear meat into shreds. (What I do at this point is stop&lt;br&gt;for the day--I take the meat out, put it in a storage bag and then strain&lt;br&gt;the broth and refrigerate them both. The next morning I remove the&lt;br&gt;separated top (fat) that has hardened. I then put the broth in a pan, put the&lt;br&gt;shredded chicken in it, chop up a green pepper (deseeded), an onion, a&lt;br&gt;couple of jalapenos (deseeded), all cut in smal  pieces, some garlic,&lt;br&gt;more salt and pepper, and then depending on the amount of chicken I put in&lt;br&gt;one or two packs of Taco Bell or your favorite taco seasoning packets. Then&lt;br&gt;I just let it slowly cook for a couple of hours (until the peppers and&lt;br&gt;onion basically disintegrate into the meat), then turn up the heat and boil&lt;br&gt;until al  the fluid is boiled away, stirring almost continuously at the end&lt;br&gt;so the meat doesn't burn. Let meat cool so you can touch it. In the&lt;br&gt;meantime take corn tortillas and dip in hot oil just a few seconds to make them&lt;br&gt;limp and drain on paper towels. Then working in an assembly line fashion,&lt;br&gt;pick up enough meat to hold in your three fingers (like your making a&lt;br&gt;homemade cigarette) and put it on one end of a tortilla and roll it up tight and&lt;br&gt;secure it with a toothpick in the middle. I make a bunch and freeze them.&lt;br&gt;Make them all before you cook them because it's too hard to make and&lt;br&gt;cook at the same time. Then just fry in a couple of inches of hot oil and&lt;br&gt;take out and drain on paper towels and salt while warm. Take the toothpicks&lt;br&gt;out after they're cooked. You can also use this meat to make shredded&lt;br&gt;chicken and cheese enchiladas or flautas (taquitos made with flour tortillas).&lt;br&gt;Enjoy--these are really good. I also make these with shredded roast&lt;br&gt;beef and have also made them with shredded pork from pork tenderloin roast.&lt;br&gt;

1.  Combine flour, salt, peppers and paprika in a medium bowl.  &lt;br&gt;2. In another small bowl, whisk together egg and milk.  &lt;br&gt;3.  Slice each chicken breast into 6 pieces.  Preheat 4-6 cups of vegetable oil in&lt;br&gt;a deep fryer to 375 degrees.  &lt;br&gt;4.  One or two at a time, dip each piece of chicken into the egg mixture, then into&lt;br&gt;the breading blend; then repeat the process so that each piece of chicken is&lt;br&gt;double-coated.  &lt;br&gt;5.  When al  chicken pieces have been breaded, arrange them on a plate and&lt;br&gt;chill for 15 minutes.  &lt;br&gt;6. When the chicken is done resting, drop each piece into the hot oil and fry&lt;br&gt;for 5-6 minutes or until each piece is browned.  &lt;br&gt;7.  As chicken fries, combine the hot sauce and margarine in a small bowl.&lt;br&gt;Microwave sauce for 20-30 seconds or just until the margarine is melted, then&lt;br&gt;stir to combine. You can also use a small saucepan for this step.  Just combine&lt;br&gt;the hot sauce and margarine in the saucepan over low heat and stir until&lt;br&gt;margarine is melted and ingredients are blended.  &lt;br&gt;8.  When chicken pieces are done frying, remove them to a plate lined with a&lt;br&gt;couple paper towels.  &lt;br&gt;9. Place the chicken pieces into a covered container such as a large jar with a&lt;br&gt;lid.  Pour the sauce over the chicken in the container, cover, and then shake&lt;br&gt;gently until each piece of chicken is coated with sauce.  Pour the chicken onto a&lt;br&gt;plate and serve the dish with bleu cheese dressing and sliced celery on the side.&lt;br&gt;Serves 2- 4 as an appetizer.&lt;br&gt;

      6 T  walnuts,Chopped&lt;br&gt;
    1/4 c  sugar&lt;br&gt;  1 1/2 c  graham cracker crumbs&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;1.  Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  &lt;br&gt;2.  Combine the flour, baking soda and baking powder in a medium bowl.  &lt;br&gt;3.  In a separate large bowl, beat together the butter and sugar with an electric&lt;br&gt;mixer.  Continue beating for about 30 seconds or until mixture turns lighter in&lt;br&gt;color.  Add the egg, milk, and vanilla and beat until smooth.  &lt;br&gt;4.  Slowly mix the dry mixture into the wet mixture.  Beat until well-combined and&lt;br&gt;then mix in the coconut flakes.  Set this cookie dough aside for now.  &lt;br&gt;5.  Melt 6 tablespoons of butter in a medium bowl in the microwave on high&lt;br&gt;temperature for about 30 seconds.  Add the sugar and stir well for 30 seconds.&lt;br&gt;Add the graham cracker crumbs and stir.  Press this mixture into the bottom of a&lt;br&gt;9x9- inch baking dish or pan.  &lt;br&gt;6.  Sprinkle the cup of chocolate chips evenly over the graham cracker crust.  &lt;br&gt;7.  Press the cookie dough into the dish, covering the chocolate chips.  Use flour&lt;br&gt;on your fingers to keep the soft dough from sticking.  &lt;br&gt;8.  Sprinkle the chopped walnuts over the dough  Use your fingers to press the&lt;br&gt;nuts into the dough.  &lt;br&gt;9.  Bake for 40-45 minutes or until the edges of the pie become light brown.  &lt;br&gt;10.

When you are ready to make your dessert, heat up a small skillet over&lt;br&gt;medium heat.  When the skillet is hot, remove it from the heat then add about 1&lt;br&gt;tablespoon of the cinnamon butter to the pan.  It should quickly melt and sizzle.&lt;br&gt;Slice the pie into 9 pieces and place one into the hot skillet.  If the pie has&lt;br&gt;cooled, you can reheat each slice by zapping it in the microwave for 30- 40&lt;br&gt;seconds.  &lt;br&gt;12.  Place a scoop of ice cream on top of the pie. Drizzle chocolate and caramel&lt;br&gt;syrup over the dessert and then sprinkle about 2 teaspoons of chopped walnuts&lt;br&gt;over the top.  Repeat for the remaining ingredients and serve sizzling in the&lt;br&gt;skillet.&lt;br&gt;

      &lt;br&gt;   &lt;br&gt;
1.  First make the pico de gallo.  This is easy.  Just combine all of the ingredients for the&lt;br&gt;pico in a small bowl and mix well.  Cover bowl and chill in the refrigerator.  2.  Now we'l&lt;br&gt;make the guacamole.  In a small bowl, smash up most of the avocado, but be sure to&lt;br&gt;leave several unsmashed chunks.  Add the remaining ingredients for the guacamole to&lt;br&gt;the avocado and mix wel .  Cover bowl and chill in the refrigerator, next to the pico.&lt;br&gt;3. Next we'll make the chili queso.  In yet another small bowl, mix together ground beef,&lt;br&gt;flour, a pinch of salt, a pinch of black pepper, and a pinch of chili powder.  Use your&lt;br&gt;hands to work the dry ingredients into the ground beef.  Brown the beef in a small skillet&lt;br&gt;over medium heat for about 5 minutes.  Use a spoon or spatula to crumble the beef as it&lt;br&gt;cooks. Cook until it's brown, then set aside.  &lt;br&gt;4.  Melt the Cheez Whiz with 2 tablespoons of milk over low heat.  When milk and&lt;br&gt;cheese has been combined, add the remaining queso ingredients.  Heat while stirring&lt;br&gt;often until cheese is smooth and creamy, then cover saucepan and remove it from the&lt;br&gt;heat.  &lt;br&gt;5.  Pre-heat a griddle or large frying pan over medium heat. Lightly butter the face of&lt;br&gt;each bun and brown the buns face-down on the heat.  &lt;br&gt;6.  Separate the ground beef into four 1/2-pound portions.  Roll each portion of meat&lt;br&gt;into a ball and then pat the meat down into a circular patty slightly larger in diameter&lt;br&gt;than the hamburger buns.  Cook the hamburger patties for 5-10 minutes per side, until&lt;br&gt;done.  Lightly salt and pepper each burger patty.  &lt;br&gt;7.  Build the burger open-faced in the following order starting with the bottom bun:On&lt;br&gt;Bottom Bun 1/2 cup shredded lettuce hamburger patty 2 tablespoons&lt;br&gt;chili queso 4 or 5 crumbled tortilla chips 2 teaspoons green onion  On Top Bun 1/2&lt;br&gt;tablespoon mayonnaise 2 tablespoons pico de gallo 2 tablespoons guacamole 4&lt;br&gt;jalapeno slices&lt;br&gt;

Preheat the oven to 375.  In a medium bowl, combine the graham cracker&lt;br&gt;crumbs, chocolate crumbs and melted butter.  Press the crumbs firmly&lt;br&gt;over just the bottom of an 8&amp;quot; springform pan.  Bake for 6 to 8&lt;br&gt;minutes.  When the crust is cool, spread the peanut butter in a&lt;br&gt;circle in the center of the crust.  Leave about an inch margin at the&lt;br&gt;sides.    In a large bowl, beat together the cream cheese, sour&lt;br&gt;cream, sugar and vanilla until smooth. Remove 1 cup of the cream&lt;br&gt;cheese mixture and pour it into the another bowl.  Add the chocolate&lt;br&gt;syrup and combine.  Pour the first cheese mixture into the springform&lt;br&gt;pan and spread it evenly over the crust.  Pour the chocolate filling&lt;br&gt;onto the other filling and spread it out.  Using the tip of a knife&lt;br&gt;swirl the chocolate into the white filling beneath it.  Lower the&lt;br&gt;oven temperature to 350.  Bake the cake for 60 to 70 minutes.  Remove&lt;br&gt;from the oven and allow it to cool.  When the cheescake is completely&lt;br&gt;cool, soften the fudge topping in the microwave for about 45 seconds,&lt;br&gt;then spread it out evenly over the cheesecake.  Be sure to cover the&lt;br&gt;entire surface of the filling.  Unwrap the peanut butter cups and&lt;br&gt;chop them into small chunks.  Sprinkle the peanut butter cup pieces&lt;br&gt;and any crumbs over the top of the cheesecake.  Chill.&lt;br&gt;

      1 ds pepper&lt;br&gt;
    1/4 t  salt&lt;br&gt;
           **Garnish**&lt;br&gt;
      1 ds cayenne pepper&lt;br&gt;
      2 T  tomato,Chopped&lt;br&gt;
     3/4 c  Monterey Jack,Shredded&lt;br&gt;

           -cheese&lt;br&gt;           five 7-inch flour tortillas&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
1.  Preheat barbecue grill to high heat.  &lt;br&gt;2.  Rub the chicken breast with some vegetable oil then grill it on the barbecue for 4 to 5&lt;br&gt;minutes per side or until done.  Lightly salt and pepper each side of the chicken while it&lt;br&gt;cooks.  Set chicken aside until it cools down enough to handle.  3. Preheat 1 tablespoon of&lt;br&gt;vegetable oil in a medium-size skillet over&lt;br&gt;medium-high heat.  &lt;br&gt;4.  Add the red pepper and onion to the pan and saute for a couple minutes until tender.  &lt;br&gt;5.  Dice the cooked chicken into small cubes and add it to the pan.  Add the corn, black&lt;br&gt;beans, spinach,jalapeno peppers, parsley, cumin, chili powder, salt, and cayenne pepper to&lt;br&gt;the pan.  Cook for another 4 minutes.  Stir well so that the spinach separates and is&lt;br&gt;incorporated into the mixture.  &lt;br&gt;6.  Remove the pan from the heat and add the cheese.  Stir until the cheese is melted.  &lt;br&gt;7.  Wrap the tortillas in a moist cloth and microwave on high temperature for 1 1/2 minutes&lt;br&gt;or until hot.  &lt;br&gt;8.  Spoon approximately one-fifth of the mixture into the center of a tortilla.  Fold in the ends&lt;br&gt;and then roll the tortilla over the mixture. Roll the tortilla very tight, then pierce with a&lt;br&gt;toothpick to hold together.  Repeat with the remaining ingredients until you have five&lt;br&gt;eggrolls.  Arrange the eggrolls on a plate, cover the plate with plastic wrap and freeze for at&lt;br&gt;least 4 hours.  Overnight is best.  &lt;br&gt;9.  While the eggrolls freeze prepare the avocado-ranch dipping sauce by combining all of&lt;br&gt;the ingredients in a small bowl.  &lt;br&gt;10.  Preheat 4-6 cups of oil to 375 degrees.  &lt;br&gt;11.  Deep fry the eggrolls in the hot oil for 12-15 minutes and remove to paper towels or a&lt;br&gt;rack to drain for about 2 minutes.  &lt;br&gt;12. Slice each eggroll diagonally lengthwise and arrange on a plate around a&lt;br&gt;small bowl of the dipping sauce.  Garnish the dipping sauce with the chopped&lt;br&gt;tomato and onion.   Serves 3-4.&lt;br&gt;

Knead&lt;br&gt;the dough into a large ball, using your hands dusted lightly with&lt;br&gt;flour. Put in a bowl, cover and let rise in a warm place about 1&lt;br&gt;hour, or until the dough has doubled in size.  Roll the dough out on&lt;br&gt;a lightly floured surface. Rol  the dough flat until it is about 21&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;long and 16&amp;quot; wide. It should be about 1/4&amp;quot; thick.  Preheat oven to&lt;br&gt;400. For the filling, combine the brown sugar and cinnamon in a bowl.&lt;br&gt;Spread the softened margarine evenly over the surface of the dough&lt;br&gt;and then sprinkle the cinnamon and sugar evenly over the surface.&lt;br&gt;Working carefully from the 21&amp;quot; side, roll the dough down to the&lt;br&gt;bottom edge. Cut the rolled dough into 1 3/4&amp;quot; slices and place 6 at a&lt;br&gt;time, evenly spaced, in a lightly greased baking pan. Bake for 10&lt;br&gt;minutes, or until light brown on top. While the rolls bake, combine&lt;br&gt;the icing ingredients.  Beat well with an electric mixer until&lt;br&gt;fluffy. When the rolls come out of the oven, coat each generously&lt;br&gt;with icing.&lt;br&gt;

Filling In a small bowl, mix brown sugar and cinnamon. Spread the softened butter over&lt;br&gt;the dough and evenly sprinkle on the sugar and cinnamon mixture.&lt;br&gt;Starting at the long edge of the dough, roll up tightly. Mark the roll every 2 inches. With&lt;br&gt;a thread cut the roll by placing the thread under the roll at your&lt;br&gt;mark, crisscross over and pull to cut.

----filling-----&lt;br&gt;
==========================&lt;br&gt;
2 c  butter; melted&lt;br&gt;
      1 c  water,Warm&lt;br&gt;
3 c  dark brown sugar; packed&lt;br&gt;
      3 pk active dry yeast&lt;br&gt;
6 tb ground cinnamon&lt;br&gt;
    1/2 c  granulated sugar&lt;br&gt;
3/4 c  chopped walnuts; optional&lt;br&gt;
    1/3 c  butter,softened&lt;br&gt;      1 c  milk,scalded and cooled&lt;br&gt;
----frosting----&lt;br&gt;
      3 lg eggs&lt;br&gt;
1 lb butter or margarine&lt;br&gt;1 lb cream cheese&lt;br&gt;
1-1/4 ts salt&lt;br&gt;
2    lbs powdered sugar&lt;br&gt;
3-1/2 c  all-purpose flour; unsifted&lt;br&gt;
2 ts lemon juice&lt;br&gt;
1/2 c  raisins, optional&lt;br&gt;
2 ts vanilla extract&lt;br&gt;
3-1/2 c  whole wheat pastry flour,-unsifted&lt;br&gt;
Combine water, yeast and sugar in large mixing bowl and let stand 5 minutes. Add&lt;br&gt;butter to cooling milk to soften. When cool, add milk mixture to yeast mixture and stir&lt;br&gt;well. Add eggs and salt and stir wel  with wire whisk. Begin adding all-purpose flour,&lt;br&gt;mixing wel  with wooden spoon until mixture resembles thick cake batter. Add raisins.&lt;br&gt;Add 2-1/2 cups whole wheat pastry flour. Mix well again until dough is quite sticky and&lt;br&gt;begins to leave sides of bowl. Place 1/2 cup remaining whole wheat pastry flour onto&lt;br&gt;board. Turn dough out and knead about 10 minutes until smooth and shiny, slowly&lt;br&gt;adding more flour if needed. (Dough should be somewhat soft and resilient, almost&lt;br&gt;sticky.)&lt;br&gt;
Shape dough into ball and place in large greased bowl, turning to grease top. Cover with&lt;br&gt;damp towel. Let rise in warm place about 45 minutes or until doubled in bulk. Turn&lt;br&gt;dough onto large floured board. Roll out to 24x20' rectangle. (Dough wil  be quite thin.)&lt;br&gt;
For fil ing mix together melted butter, brown sugar and cinnamon. Spread entire&lt;br&gt;rectangle of dough with mixture (it should be very glossy in order to produce syrup).&lt;br&gt;Sprinkle with walnuts. Roll rectangle tightly from long side (filling wil  be slightly runny&lt;br&gt;and dough wil  be soft). Make sure seam side is on bottom. Shape with hands to make&lt;br&gt;rol  uniform in size from end to end. With very sharp knife, cut roll into 16 equal portions.&lt;br&gt;Place side by side, cut sides up, in 2 well-greased 13'x9'3' metal baking pans. (Glass&lt;br&gt;pans will tend to caramelize syrup too quickly.) Cover with warm, damp towel and&lt;br&gt;let rise in warm place 30 to 40 minutes or until almost doubled in size. Bake at 350&lt;br&gt;degrees until nicely browned and filling is bubbly, about 35 minutes. Immediately invert&lt;br&gt;onto serving platter or baking sheet, allowing syrup to drip from pan onto rolls . &lt;br&gt;To make frosting: Allow butter and cream cheese to reach room temperature. Beat&lt;br&gt;cream cheese and margarine together in a bowl with a mixer. Slowly add in all&lt;br&gt;powdered sugar. Once all of the sugar is in the bowl, mix for at least an additional 12&lt;br&gt;minutes. When almost done, add the extracts.&lt;br&gt;

Place all ingredients in your machine in order recommended by your machine's&lt;br&gt;manufacturer. Place the pan in your machine. Select the dough cycle and press&lt;br&gt;start. When cycle is finished, remove the dough, knead enough to punch down&lt;br&gt;and roll to 17X10. Combine first three filling ingredients and mix well. Heat in&lt;br&gt;microwave 10 seconds to make it spreadable. Spread over rolled out dough with&lt;br&gt;rubber spatula. Get as close to the edges as possible. Sprinkle nuts or raisins&lt;br&gt;over dough. Starting with widest end, roll the dough into tight log. Cut into 1/2'&lt;br&gt;slices. Place in a lightly greased baking dish with sides. Put in warm draft-free&lt;br&gt;place and allow them to rise until double. (I turn my oven on warm and place&lt;br&gt;them inside. When the temperature light goes off, turn off the oven. I let them&lt;br&gt;rise 20-30 minutes this way. Take out to heat oven to baking temperature). Bake&lt;br&gt;at 350 for 15-20 minutes. When the rolls are done top with frosting of your&lt;br&gt;choice.&lt;br&gt;

1. Roast the head of garlic by preheating your oven to 325 degrees. Cut the&lt;br&gt;top off of a head of garlic and cut the bottom (the root end) so that the garlic wil&lt;br&gt;sit flat. Remove most of the papery skin from the garlic, but leave just enough to&lt;br&gt;hold the garlic together. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil over the garlic, then&lt;br&gt;place it in a small oven-safe casserole dish. Cover it with a lid or aluminum foil&lt;br&gt;and bake for 1 hour or until the garlic begins to brown.&lt;br&gt;2. While the garlic is roasting prepare the tomato relish by combining all of the&lt;br&gt;ingredients in a small bowl. Stir well, then cover and refrigerate until needed.&lt;br&gt;3. Prepare the artichoke by cutting about an inch off the top with a sharp knife.&lt;br&gt;Use scissors to clip the thorny tips off of al  the outer leaves so no one gets&lt;br&gt;poked. Cut the artichoke in half down through the middle, then bring some water&lt;br&gt;to a boil in a large saucepan to steam the artichokes. The water should be a&lt;br&gt;couple inches deep in the pan, but not so much as to cover the artichokes. If you&lt;br&gt;have a steamer, that will work as wel . When the water is simmering, add the&lt;br&gt;artichokes, cover, and steam for 40 to 45 minutes or until the artichoke is tender.&lt;br&gt;Preheat your barbecue grill to high heat.&lt;br&gt;4. Squeeze about 1 tablespoon of roasted garlic from the head and combine it&lt;br&gt;with the mayo, lemon juice and salt. Stir well.&lt;br&gt;5. When the steamed artichokes are cool enough to handle, use a spoon to&lt;br&gt;scrape out the fuzzy choke inside each half. Brush melted butter over the entire&lt;br&gt;surface of each steamed artichoke half and place each half, flat side-down on&lt;br&gt;the preheated grill. Grill for 4 to 6 minutes or until dark charring marks appear on&lt;br&gt;the face of each half. Serve grilled-side-up with tomato relish (strain the liquid&lt;br&gt;from the relish before serving) and roasted garlic mayonnaise on the side. &lt;br&gt;

      2    whole graham crackers,(4&lt;br&gt;           -sections,not&lt;br&gt;           --),Separated&lt;br&gt;           two 1 1/2-ounce Hershey milk&lt;br&gt;           - chocol&lt;br&gt;           -- bars&lt;br&gt;     16 lg marshmal ows&lt;br&gt;      2 T  Hershey's chocolate syrup&lt;br&gt;           -in squirt bottle&lt;br&gt;
1.  Preheat the broiler.  Arrange the graham crackers side by side&lt;br&gt;on an oven-safe plate (such as ceramic).  You can also use a baking sheet.  &lt;br&gt;
2. Stack the milk chocolate bars side by side on top of the graham crackers.&lt;br&gt;
3.  Arrange the marshmallows on the chcocolate in 4 rows -- 4 across, 4 down.&lt;br&gt;
4.  Broil the dessert on the middle rack for 1 to 3 minutes or until the&lt;br&gt;marshmallows turn light brown on top.  &lt;br&gt;
5.  Remove the dessert from the oven.  If you used a baking sheet, carefully&lt;br&gt;slide the dessert onto a serving plate.  With the squirt bottle, immediately drizzle&lt;br&gt;the chocolate syrup over the marshmal ows in a sweeping back-and-forth&lt;br&gt;motion. Drizzle the chocolate diagonally across the dessert one way, and then&lt;br&gt;the other, creating a cross-hatch pattern.  Allow the chocolate to over-shoot the&lt;br&gt;dessert so that it creates a decorative pattern on the serving plate as&lt;br&gt;well.   Serves 2-4.&lt;br&gt;

1. Prepare the cake batter following the directions on the box. If you use Duncan Hines&lt;br&gt;brand, you wil  need 1 1/3 cups of water, 1/2 cup of oil and three eggs. Preheat oven to&lt;br&gt;350 degrees.&lt;br&gt;2. To prepare the cake pans that wil  make cakes the size of Zingers, tear off 20 pieces&lt;br&gt;of aluminum foil that are each about 8 inches wide. Fold the foil in half and then in half&lt;br&gt;once more so that you have a rectangular piece of foil. Wrap this piece of foil around a&lt;br&gt;small prescription medicine bottle. Tuck in the ends and take the bottle out, leaving the&lt;br&gt;foil open at the top. This will form a little pan. Flatten the bottom so that the mini pan&lt;br&gt;stand up straight. Place this into a baking pan and repeat with the remaining pieces of&lt;br&gt;foil. When you have arranged all of the foil pans in a baking pan, spray the inside of all&lt;br&gt;the pans with non-stick cooking spray. Fil  each little pan about halfway with cake batter.&lt;br&gt;Bake cakes for 15- 17 minutes or until a toothpick stuck in the center comes out clean.&lt;br&gt;Remove the cakes from the oven and allow them to cool completely.&lt;br&gt;3. To make the filling, combine the hot water with the salt in a small bowl and stir until&lt;br&gt;the salt is dissolved. Let this mixture cool.&lt;br&gt;4. Combine the marshmallow creme, shortening, powdered sugar, and vanilla in a&lt;br&gt;medium bowl and mix wel  with an electric mixer on high speed until fluffy. Add the salt&lt;br&gt;mixture to the bowl and mix.&lt;br&gt;5. To make the chocolate frosting, combine all the frosting ingredients in a medium bowl&lt;br&gt;and mix wel  with an electric mixer until smooth.&lt;br&gt;6. To assemble your snack cakes first poke three holes with a toothpick or skewer in the&lt;br&gt;top of a cake and swirl around inside the holes making little caverns for your fil ing.&lt;br&gt;7. Use a pastry bag with a small tip to squeeze some filling into each hole. Careful not to&lt;br&gt;overfill, or your cake wil  burst open. &lt;br&gt;8. Once the cake is filled, use a butter knife to spread frosting on top of the cake over&lt;br&gt;the holes. Drag a fork lengthwise over the frosting making groves, just like the real&lt;br&gt;thing.&lt;br&gt;

Arrange&lt;br&gt;the chicken pieces skin-side up on broiler pan in single layer and&lt;br&gt;baste with enough of mixture to evenly coat skin side. Turn and baste&lt;br&gt;other side. Turn again to skin side up and broil 6&amp;quot; from the heat,&lt;br&gt;brushing with additional sauce every few minutes until skin is really&lt;br&gt;crispy and golden brown, approximately 5 to 8 minutes for large&lt;br&gt;pieces. BASTING MIXTURE-Mix juices, oil, turmericc, salt and pepper.&lt;br&gt;This makes enough to baste nine pieces. .&lt;br&gt;

Cook the chicken on the open grill for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or&lt;br&gt;until the skin is golden brown and crispy.  Be sure the flames are&lt;br&gt;not scorching the chicken, or the skin may turn black before the&lt;br&gt;center is done. Lower the heat if necessary. Turn the chicken often&lt;br&gt;as it cooks. Cut the chicken into 8 pieces, with a large, sharp&lt;br&gt;knife, cutting the breast in half and cutting the thighs from the&lt;br&gt;legs.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;A name=215&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;       Fake Almond Roca&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      1 c  butter&lt;br&gt;      1 c  sugar&lt;br&gt;      3 T  water&lt;br&gt;      1 t  light corn syrup&lt;br&gt;      1 c  fine chop almonds,Toasted&lt;br&gt;      1 c  milk-chocolate chips&lt;br&gt;
Melt the butter in a saucepan.  Add the sugar, water, and corn syrup.&lt;br&gt;
Cook the mixture over med. heat, stirring.  When the sugar dissolves&lt;br&gt;and the mixture begins to boil, raise the heat and bring the mixture&lt;br&gt;to 290F degrees on a cooking thermometer. This is called the&lt;br&gt;soft-crack stage. It will be light brown in color, and syrup will&lt;br&gt;separate into threads that are not brittle when dribbled into cold&lt;br&gt;water. Quickly stir in 1/2 cup chopped almonds.  Immediately pour the&lt;br&gt;mixture onto an ungreased baking sheet. Wait 2 or 3 minutes for the&lt;br&gt;candy surface to firm, then sprinkle on the chocolate chips. In a few&lt;br&gt;minutes, when the chips have softened, spread the chocolate evenly&lt;br&gt;over the surface. Sprinkle the remaining almonds over the melted&lt;br&gt;chocolate. When the chocolate hardens, crack the candy into pieces.&lt;br&gt;Store covered. VARIATIONS: To get a candy more like the Heath bar or&lt;br&gt;Hersheys Skor, follow the same directions above except omit step 9.&lt;br&gt;

Combine the first four ingredients in a saucepan over med. heat.&lt;br&gt;Stir occasionally, until the mixture comes to a full boil.  Let it boil&lt;br&gt;for 7 min.  Turn the heat off and let the syrup cool for 15 min. Add&lt;br&gt;the maple flavoring and stir.  When completely cool, transfer the&lt;br&gt;syrup to a covered plastic or glass container. VARIATION: For syrup&lt;br&gt;with a butter flavor, just add 3 tbsp. of butter to the mixture&lt;br&gt;before heating. For a lighter syrup, use a sugar substitute instead&lt;br&gt;of the regular sugar.&lt;br&gt;

Freeze the candy bars.  Beat the eggs by hand until fluffy. Slowly&lt;br&gt;beat in the sugar.  Add the cream, half &amp;amp; half, and vanilla and mix&lt;br&gt;well. Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze. While the&lt;br&gt;ice cream is freezing, place the frozen candy bars in a plastic bag&lt;br&gt;and break them into small pieces with a knife handle. When the ice&lt;br&gt;cream is done, remove it from the ice cream maker and add the candy&lt;br&gt;pieces. Mix well with a large spoon and store in the freezer.&lt;br&gt;VARIATIONS: Try substituting other ingredients for the Health bar&lt;br&gt;chunks, just as Ben &amp;amp; Jerry have. Try Reese's Peanut Butter Cups,&lt;br&gt;Oreo cookies, Kit Kat bars, Rollo cups, M&amp;amp; Ms, and chunks of raw&lt;br&gt;cookie dough.&lt;br&gt;

Preheat oven to 250F.  Combine the popcorn and peanuts in a metal&lt;br&gt;bowl or on a cookie sheet and place in the preheated oven. Combine&lt;br&gt;all of the remaining ingredients in a saucepan. Stirring over med.&lt;br&gt;heat, bring the mixture to a boil.  Using a cooking thermometer,&lt;br&gt;bring the mixture to the hard-ball stage (the point at which the&lt;br&gt;syrup, when dripped into cold water, forms a hard but pliable ball).&lt;br&gt;This will take about 20 to 25 minutes (or until you notice the mixture&lt;br&gt;turning dark brown). Remove the popcorn and peanuts from the&lt;br&gt;oven and , working quickly, pour the caramel mixture in a fine stream&lt;br&gt;over them. Then place them back in the oven for 15 minutes.  Mix well&lt;br&gt;every five minutes, so that all of the popcorn is coated.  Cool and&lt;br&gt;store in a covered container to preserve freshness.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;A name=221&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;       Fake Chick-Fil-A-Chicken Sandwich&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      3 c  peanut oil&lt;br&gt;      1    egg&lt;br&gt;      1 c  milk&lt;br&gt;      1 c  flour&lt;br&gt;  2 1/2 T  powdered sugar&lt;br&gt;    1/2 t  pepper&lt;br&gt;      2 T  salt&lt;br&gt;      2    skinless,boneless chicken&lt;br&gt;           -breasts,,halved&lt;br&gt;      4    plain hamburger buns&lt;br&gt;      2 T  butter,Melted&lt;br&gt;      8    dill pickle,Slices&lt;br&gt;
Heat the peanut oil in a pressure cooker over med. heat to about&lt;br&gt;400F. In a small bowl, beat the egg and stir in the milk.  In a&lt;br&gt;separate bowl, combine the flour, sugar, pepper, and salt. dip each&lt;br&gt;piece of chicken in milk until it is fully moistened. Roll the&lt;br&gt;moistened chicken in the flour mixture until completely coated. Drop&lt;br&gt;all four chicken pieces into the hot oil and close the pressure&lt;br&gt;cooker. When steam starts shooting through the pressure release, set&lt;br&gt;the timer for 3-1/2 minutes. While the chicken is cooking, spread a&lt;br&gt;coating of melted butter on the face of each bun. When the chicken is&lt;br&gt;done, remove it from the oil and drain or blot on paper towels. Place&lt;br&gt;two pickles on each bottom bun; add a chicken breast, then the top&lt;br&gt;bun. To make a deluxe chicken sandwich, simply add two tomato slices&lt;br&gt;and a leaf of lettuce. Mayonnaise also goes well on this sandwich--it&lt;br&gt;is a side order at the restaurant.&lt;br&gt;

Cut the potatoes in half lengthwise, and then into 1/4&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;strips. Put the potatoes into the sugar solution and soak for 15&lt;br&gt;minutes. Remove the potatoes and dry them thoroughly on paper towels.&lt;br&gt;The right oil temperature is crucial here. To test the oil, fry a&lt;br&gt;couple of potato slices for 6 minutes. Remove and cool, then taste.&lt;br&gt;The fries should no get too dark too soon and should be soft in the&lt;br&gt;middle. If the oil is too hot, turn it down and test again. The fries&lt;br&gt;should not be undercooked, either. If they are, turn up the heat.&lt;br&gt;When the oil temperature is just right, put all of the potato slices&lt;br&gt;in the oil for 1 minute.  This is the blanching stage.  Take the&lt;br&gt;fries out of the oil and let them cool.  When the fries have cooled,&lt;br&gt;place them into the oil again for 5 minutes, or until golden brown.&lt;br&gt;Remove from the oil and place on a paper towel-covered plate. Salt to&lt;br&gt;taste.&lt;br&gt;

Combine all of the ingredients in a saucepan.  Cover and cook over&lt;br&gt;mediumheat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has completely dissolved.&lt;br&gt;Remove the mixture from the heat and let it cool. Be sure to keep it&lt;br&gt;covered. Store in any empty bottle with a screw top or another bottle&lt;br&gt;with a resealable lid. Note: It is very important that you use a&lt;br&gt;covered saucepan when making this drink.  the alcohol will boil away&lt;br&gt;if the solution is not covered when it gets hot. Also,the longer this&lt;br&gt;drink is bottled and stored in a dark, cool place, the better it will&lt;br&gt;taste. For the best flavor, store it for at least thirty days before&lt;br&gt;drinking. &lt;br&gt;

1. Form the ground beef into a patty that is about 1 inch wider than&lt;br&gt;the&lt;br&gt;circumference of the hamburger bun.&lt;br&gt;2. Preheat a non-stick frying pan to medium/high heat. Fry the patty in&lt;br&gt;the&lt;br&gt;pan for 3 to 4 minutes per side or until done. Season both sides of the&lt;br&gt;beef with seasoned salt and ground black pepper.&lt;br&gt;3. As the meat cooks prepare the bun by spreading approximately 1/2&lt;br&gt;tablespoon of mayonnaise on the face of the top bun.&lt;br&gt;4. Place the lettuce on the mayonnaise, followed by the tomato slice.&lt;br&gt;5. When the beef is done place the patty on the bottom bun.&lt;br&gt;6. Spread about 1/2 tablespoon of mustard over the top of the beef&lt;br&gt;patty.&lt;br&gt;7. Spoon about 1/2 tablespoon of relish over the mustard.&lt;br&gt;8. Sprinkle the chopped onion onto the relish.&lt;br&gt;9. Arrange the pickles on the chopped onion.&lt;br&gt;10. Bring the two halves of the burger together and serve with gumption.&lt;br&gt;

 &lt;br&gt;  **Fiddle Faddle,(butter-toffee with-- almonds)**&lt;br&gt;    3/4 c  granulated sugar&lt;br&gt;    1/4 c  brown sugar&lt;br&gt;    1/2 c  butter,(1 stick)&lt;br&gt;    1/2 c  corn syrup&lt;br&gt;    1/2 c  water&lt;br&gt;    1/2 t  salt&lt;br&gt;    1/2 t  vanilla&lt;br&gt;  1 1/3    bags plain or -natural-flavored microwave -- popcorn&lt;br&gt;    1/2 c  roasted almonds&lt;br&gt;
           **Zonkers**&lt;br&gt;      1 c  granulated sugar&lt;br&gt;      4 T  butter&lt;br&gt;    1/2 c  corn syrup&lt;br&gt;    1/2 c  water&lt;br&gt;    1/2 t  salt&lt;br&gt;    1/2 t  vanilla&lt;br&gt;  1 1/3    bags butter-flavored -microwave popcorn&lt;br&gt;
1.  For either recipe, combine sugar, butter, corn syrup, water and&lt;br&gt;salt in a large saucepan over medium heat.  You're going to bring the &lt;br&gt;candy to 265-275 degrees, or what is known as the hard ball stage.  &lt;br&gt;For this it's best to use a candy thermometer.  If you don't have one,  &lt;br&gt;don't worry. Drip the candy into a small glass of cold water.  If the candy&lt;br&gt;forms a very hard yet slightly pliable ball, bingo, you're there.  Watch your&lt;br&gt;mixture closely so that it doesn't boil over.  &lt;br&gt;2.  While candy cooks, pop both bags of popcorn and spread about&lt;br&gt;2 quarts or 1 1/3 bags of popcorn (plus almonds for Fiddle Faddle) &lt;br&gt;on one large or two small cookie sheets. Put the popcorn in your oven &lt;br&gt;set on its lowest temperature.  This will keep the popcorn hot so that the&lt;br&gt;candy will coat better.  &lt;br&gt;3.  When your candy has reached the hard ball stage, add the vanilla.  &lt;br&gt;4.  Pull the popcorn from the oven and, working quickly, pour the candy &lt;br&gt;over the popcorn in thin streams.  Mix the popcorn so that each kernel is &lt;br&gt;coated with candy, put the popcorn back into the oven for five more minutes,&lt;br&gt;then stir once again. This will help to coat each kernel.  You can repeat this&lt;br&gt;step once more if necessary to get all of the popcorn coated.  Pour popcorn&lt;br&gt;onto a large sheet of wax paper to cool.  Spread the popcorn out, but be&lt;br&gt;careful...it's hot.  &lt;br&gt;5.  When popcorn is cool, break it up and immediately put it into a tightly sealed&lt;br&gt;container, such as Tupperware.  This will ensure that it stays fresh.  This stuff&lt;br&gt;gets stale very quickly in moist climates if left out.  Makes about 4 quarts.  &lt;br&gt;

&lt;A name=241&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;       French Fries&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;

To make French Fries at home, use only long white Burbank Russets.&lt;br&gt;Peel and cut in half lengthwise.  It will be easier to manage them&lt;br&gt;when you cut each then into strips with a sharp knife. Place cut&lt;br&gt;sides of potatoes on a board and remove a thing slice from each end&lt;br&gt;and a slice from the rounded longside of it, too. You know have&lt;br&gt;almost a rectangle shape to work with. Slice this into 1/4&amp;quot; thick&lt;br&gt;strips. Place in a deep refrigerator container.&lt;br&gt;
Mix 1 quart water with 1/2 cup white vinegar, repeating it until you&lt;br&gt;have enough to cover potatoes. Cover the container and chill the&lt;br&gt;submerged poratoes several hours. This draws out the starch that&lt;br&gt;makes a fried potato, otherwise limp and holds the grease. Drain them&lt;br&gt;well on paper toweling.&lt;br&gt;
Drop a few at a time, using a French frying basket, into 425 degrees&lt;br&gt;F -- oil, at least 4&amp;quot; deep in heavy 2 1/2 quart saucepan. Let them&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;blanche&amp;quot; in the oil rather than fry completely, removing the&lt;br&gt;potatoes after 1 minute. At once drop them into a freezer container&lt;br&gt;or on a cookie sheet &amp;amp; place in your freezer for 10 minutes. Return&lt;br&gt;them to the oil to fry till golden brown at that time, draining them&lt;br&gt;well on paper toweling.&lt;br&gt;
Salt them as you wish, which also helps to evaporate any excess&lt;br&gt;greease ont he finished potatoes.  Most of the salt will fall off&lt;br&gt;when the potatoes are transfered to serving plates.&lt;br&gt;
If the oil is not hot enough the potatoes will be greasy. A good&lt;br&gt;combination is 1 pint corn oil to 1 cup Crisco shortening, using as&lt;br&gt;much as is needed for the amount you are preparing, keeping ti 4&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;deep at 425 degrees F -- in the pan.&lt;br&gt;

Sprinkle the yeast over very warm water in a large bowl (Very warm&lt;br&gt;water should feel comfortably warm when dropped on wrist.) Stir until yeast&lt;br&gt;dissolves. Add sugar, the 1/4 cup butter or margarine and salt to hot&lt;br&gt;milk and stir until the sugar dissolves and butter or margarine is melted.&lt;br&gt;Cool mixture to 105 to 115 degrees. Add milk mixture to yeast, then beat in&lt;br&gt;egg. Beat in 4 cups of the flour, 1 cup at a time, to form a soft dough. Use&lt;br&gt;some of the remaining 1/2 cup of the flour to dust a pastry cloth.&lt;br&gt;Knead the dough lightly for 5 minutes, working in the remaining flour (use it&lt;br&gt;for flouring the pastry cloth and your hands). Place dough in a warm&lt;br&gt;buttered bowl; turn greased side up. Cover and let rise in a warm place until&lt;br&gt;doubled in bulk, about 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hours. Punch dough down and knead&lt;br&gt;4 to 5 minutes on a lightly floured pastry cloth. Dough will be sticky,&lt;br&gt;but use as little flour as possible for flouring your hands and the pastry&lt;br&gt;cloth, otherwise the rolls will not be as feathery light as they should&lt;br&gt;be. Pinch off small chunks of dough and shape into round rolls about 1-1/2&lt;br&gt;to 1-3/4 inches in diameter. Place in neat rows, not quite touching, in a&lt;br&gt;well-buttered 13 x 9 x 2 inch pan. Cover rolls and let rise in a warm&lt;br&gt;place until doubled in bulk, 30 to 40 minutes. Brush tops of rolls with&lt;br&gt;melted butter or margarine, then bake in a 375 degree oven for 18 to 20&lt;br&gt;minutes or until nicely browned. Serve warm with plenty of butter. &lt;br&gt;
This recipe yields about 2 dozen rolls.&lt;br&gt;

Add the dry mixture to the wet mixture and mix until dough forms.  &lt;br&gt;Mix in the white chocolate and macadamia nuts.  &lt;br&gt;5.  Preheat oven to 300 degrees while you let the dough rest for 30-60 &lt;br&gt;minutes in the refrigerator.  &lt;br&gt;6.  Measure out about 2 1/2 tablespoons of the dough and form a ball.  &lt;br&gt;Drop each ball of dough onto an ungreased cookie sheet about 3 inches &lt;br&gt;apart and bake for 12-14 minutes.  Do not over bake! Cookies should &lt;br&gt;come out of the oven appearing slightly browned, yet undercooked.  &lt;br&gt;When cooled the cookies will be soft and chewy like the original.  &lt;br&gt;
Makes 16-18 cookies.&lt;br&gt;

Use only ground round.  Allow 1/4 lb. per person.  Shape that much&lt;br&gt;into 2 thin patties ( use the lid to an 8 oz. margarine cup in&lt;br&gt;which to shape the patties). Press hamburger into lid evenly.  Makes&lt;br&gt;it very flat &amp;amp; uniform in size.  It drops right out when you bend the&lt;br&gt;lid a bit. Place each patty on a  square of waxed paper,&lt;br&gt;stacking these in a coffee can, with a tight fitting lid.  Freeze&lt;br&gt;them this way to use within 3 months, removing only as many patties&lt;br&gt;as you need at a time. Lightly oil a flat grill, the kind you would&lt;br&gt;ordinarily use for making pancakes. Get the grill HOT and sear each &lt;br&gt;patty quickly in about 1 Tablespoon oil -- turning only once to sear the &lt;br&gt;other side. Then depending on the degree of doneness, adjust heat to &lt;br&gt;medium-low for additional cooking.  Do not use a skillet with collared &lt;br&gt;sides or you'll trap in vapors, moisture and you will be &amp;quot;frying&amp;quot; the &lt;br&gt;hamburgers rather than searing them.&lt;br&gt;

Preheat the barbecue or stovetop grill.  To prepare spread, put 3&lt;br&gt;tbsp of the mayo into a small bowl and add the parsley, oregano, and&lt;br&gt;a pinch of salt.  Set this and the remaining mayo aside until you're&lt;br&gt;ready to make the sandwich.  Prepare the bell pepper by cutting it&lt;br&gt;into quarters and seeding it.  Brush the entire surface with olive&lt;br&gt;oil.  Slice the zucchini, squash, and eggplant into lengthwise slices&lt;br&gt;with oil as well.  Cook the red pepper on a hot grill for 2 or 3&lt;br&gt;mintues.  At that point add the remaining vegetables to the grill and&lt;br&gt;cook everything for 4 to 5 minutes or until all the vegetables are&lt;br&gt;tender.  Be sure to salt the vegetables and turn them halfway through&lt;br&gt;the cooking time.  When the veggies are tender and begin to char,&lt;br&gt;remove them from the grill and prepare each sandwich by first cutting&lt;br&gt;the french rolls in half lengthwise through the middle.  Spread the&lt;br&gt;parsley-mayo mixture over the bottom of the rolls.  Arrange the&lt;br&gt;zucchini onto the rolls.  Stack the yellow squash and then the&lt;br&gt;eggplant.  Peel the skin off the red peppers and then add to the&lt;br&gt;sandwiches.  Arrange the onions over the peppers.  Divide the&lt;br&gt;parmesan cheese and sprinkle it over the peppers.  Arrange the onions&lt;br&gt;and tomato slices next.  Add the lettuce and spread the mayo on the&lt;br&gt;top of the rolls.  Close sandwiches and cut in half.  Pierce each&lt;br&gt;half with a toothpick and serve.&lt;br&gt;

             **other**&lt;br&gt;
      2 T  white vinegar&lt;br&gt;
      1    boneless pork loin roast,(3 - to 4 pounds)&lt;br&gt;
      1 T  granulated sugar&lt;br&gt;
           vegetable oil&lt;br&gt;
      4 c  thinly-sliced cabbage&lt;br&gt;
  **Sauce**&lt;br&gt;
      4 c  hickory smoking chips&lt;br&gt;
      2    15-ounce cans tomato puree&lt;br&gt;
           **Spice Rub**&lt;br&gt;
      1 c  white vinegar&lt;br&gt;
      2 T  kosher salt&lt;br&gt;
    3/4 c  brown sugar&lt;br&gt;
      2 t  black pepper,Cracked&lt;br&gt;
      2 T  vegetable oil&lt;br&gt;
      1 t  paprika&lt;br&gt;
    1/2 t  onion powder&lt;br&gt;
    1/2 t  onion powder&lt;br&gt;
    1/2 t  liquid smoke,(hickory)&lt;br&gt;
    1/2 t  sage,Ground&lt;br&gt;
      1    clove garlic,minced&lt;br&gt;
    1/2 t  thyme&lt;br&gt;
    1/4 t  salt&lt;br&gt;
    1/4 t  cayenne&lt;br&gt;
    1/4 t  black pepper,Coarse Ground&lt;br&gt;
       &lt;br&gt;
      8    Kaiser rolls&lt;br&gt;
1.  Make the marinated cabbage at least one day prior to building your sandwiches.&lt;br&gt;Like cole slaw, this garnish needs some time to develop in the fridge.  Combine the&lt;br&gt;vinegar and sugar in a medium bowl.  Add the cabbage, stir, cover the bowl and store it&lt;br&gt;in the refrigerator until you are ready to make the sandwiches.  &lt;br&gt;2.  Put the wood chips in a bowl and cover with water.  Let the wood soak  for at least 1&lt;br&gt;hour.  Light the charcoal after it has been arranged around the inside edge of your grill.&lt;br&gt;You don't want coals directly under your pork.  When the coals are hot, drain the water&lt;br&gt;from the wood chips and sprinkle the chips over the top of the coals. You should now&lt;br&gt;have smoke.  &lt;br&gt;3.  Combine the spices for the rub in a small bowl and mix well.  &lt;br&gt;4.  Rub some vegetable oil over the surface of the pork roast.  Sprinkle the spices over&lt;br&gt;the entire surface of the roast.  &lt;br&gt;5. Place the roast in the center of your grill and put the lid on.  Let the pork cook for 3 to&lt;br&gt;4 hours or until the internal temperature of the roast reaches 175 to 180 degrees.  &lt;br&gt;6.  As the pork cooks, make the sauce by combining the ingredients in a medium&lt;br&gt;saucepan over medium/low heat. Let the sauce simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, then cover&lt;br&gt;and remove from heat. Set this aside until your pork is ready.  &lt;br&gt;7.  When the pork is done, remove it from the grill and let it sit to cool for 15 to 20&lt;br&gt;minutes or until you can handle it.  Now you want to tear the meat along the grain,&lt;br&gt;making bite-size strips of shredded pork.  &lt;br&gt;8.  Put the shredded pork into a large saucepan over medium heat.  Add 2 cups of the&lt;br&gt;sauce to the pan and stir. Keep the rest of the sauce for later to serve on the side.&lt;br&gt;Cook the pork for 15 minutes or until it is heated through. &lt;br&gt;9.  Grill the faces of the rolls and stack about 1 cup of pork onto the bottom half of each&lt;br&gt;rol . Add a rounded tablespoon of marinated cabbage on top of the pork, add a&lt;br&gt;tablespoon or so of extra sauce on top of that, then cap off each sandwich&lt;br&gt;with the top half of the roll.  &lt;br&gt;

Make the apricot dipping sauce by&lt;br&gt;combing those ingredients in a medium bowl.  Cover and refrigerate this sauce&lt;br&gt;as well, until your chicken is ready.  &lt;br&gt;3.  Prepare the breading by combining the corn flake crumbs, crushed red&lt;br&gt;pepper flakes, cayenne pepper, cumin, salt, paprika,  onion powder, and garlic in&lt;br&gt;a medium bowl.  &lt;br&gt;4.  Beat the egg in a medium bowl, add the 1 cup of milk and stir.  &lt;br&gt;5.  Pour the flour into another medium bowl.  &lt;br&gt;6.  Slice each chicken breast lengthwise into strips approximately 1/2-inch wide.&lt;br&gt;7.  When the oil is hot, bread your chicken by first coating each strip with flour.&lt;br&gt;Dip the chicken into the egg/milk mixture and then back into the flour.  Dip each&lt;br&gt;chicken strip back in the egg/milk mixture and then in the corn flake crumb&lt;br&gt;mixture.  Be sure to coat each chicken piece thoroughly with the corn flake&lt;br&gt;crumbs.  &lt;br&gt;8.  Fry 6 to 8 coated chicken strips at a time in the oil for 4 to 5 minutes or until&lt;br&gt;the chicken is golden brown.  Drain and serve chicken with the dipping sauces&lt;br&gt;on the side.   &lt;br&gt;

           **Centers**&lt;br&gt;    1/4 c  whole milk&lt;br&gt;      5    unwrapped caramels&lt;br&gt;      1 T  light corn syrup&lt;br&gt;      1 t  peanut butter&lt;br&gt;    1/4 t  vanilla&lt;br&gt;    1/4 t  salt&lt;br&gt;  1 1/4 c  powdered sugar&lt;br&gt;           **Outside**&lt;br&gt;     20    unwrapped caramels&lt;br&gt;  1 1/2 t  water&lt;br&gt;      2 c  dry roasted peanuts&lt;br&gt;
1.  Combine all ingredients for the centers, except the powdered sugar, in a&lt;br&gt;smal  saucepan over low heat.  Stir often as the caramel slowly melts.&lt;br&gt;When the mixture is smooth, add 3/4 cup of powdered sugar.  Stir.  Save&lt;br&gt;the remaining 1/2 cup of powdered sugar for later.  &lt;br&gt;2.  Use a candy thermometer to bring the mixture to exactly 230 degrees, stirring&lt;br&gt;often, then turn off the heat.  &lt;br&gt;3.  When the temperature of the candy begins to drop, add the remaining 1/2&lt;br&gt;cup powdered sugar to the pan, then use a hand mixer on high speed to&lt;br&gt;combine.  Keep mixing until the candy cools and thickens and can no longer be&lt;br&gt;mixed.  That should take a minute or two.&lt;br&gt;4. Let the candy cool in the pan for 15 to 20 minutes, or until it can be touched.&lt;br&gt;Don't let it sit too long -- you want the candy to still be warm and pliable when&lt;br&gt;you shape it.  Take a tablespoon-size portion and roll it between your palms or&lt;br&gt;on a countertop until it forms a roll about 4 1/2-inches long.  Repeat with the&lt;br&gt;remaining center candy mixture and place the rolls on wax paper.  You should&lt;br&gt;have 8 rolls.  Let the center rol s sit out for an hour or two to firm up.  &lt;br&gt;5.  Combine the 20 caramels with the 1 1/2 teaspoons of water in a small&lt;br&gt;saucepan over low heat.  Stir often until the caramels melt completely, then turn&lt;br&gt;off the heat.  If you work fast this caramel wil  stay warm while you make the&lt;br&gt;candy bars.  &lt;br&gt;6. Pour the peanuts onto a baking sheet or other flat surface.  Using a basting&lt;br&gt;brush and working quickly, &amp;quot;paint&amp;quot; a coating of caramel onto one side of a&lt;br&gt;center roll.  Quickly turn the center over, caramel-side-down, onto the peanuts&lt;br&gt;and press gently so that the peanuts stick to the surface of the candy.  Paint&lt;br&gt;more caramel onto the other side of the roll and press it down onto the peanuts.&lt;br&gt;The candy should have a solid layer of peanuts covering all sides.  If needed,&lt;br&gt;brush additional caramel onto the roll, then turn it onto the peanuts to coat the&lt;br&gt;roll completely.  Place the candy bar onto wax paper, and repeat with the&lt;br&gt;remaining ingredients.  Eat when completely cool.   &lt;br&gt;

&lt;A name=299&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;       Honeybaked® Ham Glaze&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      1    fully-cooked shank half ham&lt;br&gt;           - bone-in (pre-sliced,is be&lt;br&gt;      1 c  sugar&lt;br&gt;    1/4 t  cinnamon,Ground&lt;br&gt;    1/4 t  nutmeg,Ground&lt;br&gt;    1/4 t  clove,Ground&lt;br&gt;    1/8 t  paprika&lt;br&gt;           dash ginger,Ground&lt;br&gt;           dash allspice,Ground&lt;br&gt;
1. First you must slice your ham. Use a very sharp knife to cut the ham&lt;br&gt;into very thin slices around the bone. Do not cut all the way down to&lt;br&gt;the bone or the meat may not hold together properly as it is being glazed.&lt;br&gt;You want the slices to be quite thin, but not so thin that they begin to&lt;br&gt;fall apart or off the bone. You may wish to turn the ham onto its flat end&lt;br&gt;and cut around it starting at the bottom. You can then spin the ham as you&lt;br&gt;slice around and work your way up.&lt;br&gt;2. Mix the remaining ingredients together in a small bowl.&lt;br&gt;3. Lay down a couple sheets of wax paper onto a flat surface, such as&lt;br&gt;your kitchen counter. Pour the sugar mixture onto the wax paper and spread&lt;br&gt;it around evenly.&lt;br&gt;4. Pick up the ham and roll it over the sugar mixture so that it is&lt;br&gt;well coated. Do not coat the flat end of the ham, just the outer surface&lt;br&gt;which you have sliced through.&lt;br&gt;5. Turn the ham onto its flat end on a plate. Use a blow torch with a&lt;br&gt;medium-size flame to caramelize the sugar. Wave the torch over the&lt;br&gt;sugar with rapid movement, so that the sugar bubbles and browns, but does not&lt;br&gt;burn. Spin the plate so that you can torch the entire surface of the ham. Repeat&lt;br&gt;the coating and caramelizing process until the ham has been well-glazed (don't&lt;br&gt;expect to use all of the sugar mixture). Serve the ham cold or re-heated,&lt;br&gt;

Drizzle oil over pasta to keep from sticking together.&lt;br&gt;Gently toss the pasta, then put it into a covered container and let&lt;br&gt;it cool in the fridge for 30 minutes or so.  While the pasta is&lt;br&gt;cooling, prepare the vegetables.  Remove the seeds from tomato and&lt;br&gt;dice.  Mince green part of green onions and dice cucumber in small&lt;br&gt;mince.  When pasta is cooled add vegetables and sprinkle salt over&lt;br&gt;the salad to taste and put back in fridge until well chilled.

&lt;A name=305&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;       Hot Dog On A Stick Hot Dog&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      2 c  flour&lt;br&gt;    3/4 c  corn meal&lt;br&gt;    1/2 c  sugar&lt;br&gt;  1 3/4 t  salt&lt;br&gt;      1 t  baking soda&lt;br&gt;  1 3/4 c  fat-free milk&lt;br&gt;      2    egg yolks,slightly beaten&lt;br&gt;     10    turkey hot dogs&lt;br&gt;      8 c  vegetable oil,up to 10&lt;br&gt;      5    pairs of chopsticks&lt;br&gt;
1.  Preheat oil in a deep pan or fryer to 375 degrees.  &lt;br&gt;2.  Combine the flour, corn meal, sugar, salt and baking soda in a large bowl.  &lt;br&gt;3. Combine the milk and egg yolks to the dry ingredients and mix with an electric&lt;br&gt;mixer on high speed until batter is smooth.  &lt;br&gt;4.  Dry off the hot dogs with a paper towel.  Jab the thin end of a single chopstick&lt;br&gt;about halfway into the end of each hot dog.  &lt;br&gt;5.  When the oil is hot, tip the bowl of batter so that you can completely coat&lt;br&gt;each hot dog.  Roll the hot dog in the batter until it is entirely covered with batter.&lt;br&gt;6.  Hold the hot dog up by the stick and let some of the batter drip off.  Quickly&lt;br&gt;submerge the hot dog in the oil and spin it slowly so that the coating cooks&lt;br&gt;evenly. After about 20 seconds you can use a lid to the deep fryer or pan to put&lt;br&gt;weight on the stick, keeping the hot dog fully immersed in the oil.  You can&lt;br&gt;cook a couple dogs at a time this way.  Cook for 5-6 minutes or until&lt;br&gt;coating is dark brown.  Turn them once or twice as they cook.  Drain on paper&lt;br&gt;towels while cooling, and repeat with remaining hot dogs.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;A name=309&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;       How To Make Real Belgian Fries!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;Start by peeling some potatoes. Cut them in slices 1 cm (3/8&amp;quot;) thick&lt;br&gt;and finally cut them into fries of 1 cm square. Dry the fries well in&lt;br&gt;paper or a towel before putting them into the oil.&lt;br&gt;
Heat the oil in a hot frying pan or deep fryer to a temperature of&lt;br&gt;160C (320F). Put in a handfull of fries: not more at once because the&lt;br&gt;oil will cool down too much. Fry for a few minutes (4-8 depending on&lt;br&gt;the thickness and the kind of potatoes), stir regularly to prevent&lt;br&gt;sticking. Put the fries into a large bowl with kitchen paper and let&lt;br&gt;them 'sweat' for at least 1/2 hour.&lt;br&gt;
Finally heat to 190C (375F) and fry for 2 minutes until crispy and&lt;br&gt;golden brown. This way the fries will be crispy on the outside and&lt;br&gt;soft on the inside, the way they should be!&lt;br&gt;

1.  Trim any excess skin and fat from the chicken pieces.  Preheat&lt;br&gt;the oil in a deep-fryer to 350 degrees.  &lt;br&gt;
2.  Combine the water, salt and MSG for the marinade in a large bowl.  Add the&lt;br&gt;chicken to the bowl and let it sit for 20 minutes.  Turn the chicken a couple times&lt;br&gt;as it marinates.  &lt;br&gt;
3. Combine the beaten egg and milk in a medium bowl.  In another medium&lt;br&gt;bowl, combine the remaining coating ingredients (flour, salt, pepper and MSG).&lt;br&gt;
4.  When the chicken has marinated, transfer each piece to paper towels&lt;br&gt;so that excess liquid can drain off.  Working with one piece at a time, first&lt;br&gt;coat the chicken with the dry flour mixture, then the egg and milk mixture,&lt;br&gt;and then back into the flour.  Be sure that each piece is coated very generously.&lt;br&gt;Stack the chicken on a plate or cookie sheet until each piece has been coated.&lt;br&gt;
5.  Drop the chicken, one piece at a time into the hot oil.  Fry half of the chicken&lt;br&gt;at a time (4 pieces) for 12-15 minutes, or until it is golden brown.  You should be&lt;br&gt;sure to stir the chicken around halfway through the cooking time so that each&lt;br&gt;piece cooks evenly.  &lt;br&gt;
6. Remove the chicken to a rack or towels to drain for about 5 minutes before&lt;br&gt;eating.   &lt;br&gt;
Serves 3-4 (8 pieces of chicken).&lt;br&gt;

     10 oz Pillsbury Pizza Dough Tube&lt;br&gt;      2 T  butter&lt;br&gt;      1 t  garlic salt&lt;br&gt;           Kraft 100% Parmesan,Grated&lt;br&gt;           -Cheese&lt;br&gt;
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.&lt;br&gt;
Unrol  the dough on a cutting board.&lt;br&gt;
Position it lengthwise (longer from let to right than from top to bottom).With a&lt;br&gt;sharp knife, cut the  dough in half down the middle. Then cut each of those&lt;br&gt;halves vertically  in half, and then in half once more so that you have 8 even&lt;br&gt;strips of  dough.&lt;br&gt;
Being careful not to stretch the dough, place each strip on a lightly greased&lt;br&gt;cookie sheet and bake for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the top just  turns golden&lt;br&gt;brown.    &lt;br&gt;
While the dough bakes, melt the butter (on the stove or in the  microwave on&lt;br&gt;high for 15 to 20 seconds), then add the garlic salt and stir  until it dissolves.&lt;br&gt;Remove the browned dough from the oven and with a pastry brush or spoon&lt;br&gt;spread a coating of garlic butter over each piece.&lt;br&gt;
Sprinkle a generous amount of Parmesan cheese on each.&lt;br&gt;

5.  Drop dough by tablespoonfuls onto an ungreased baking sheet.  Bake for 10-&lt;br&gt;12 minutes, or until cookies are just starting to darken around the edges.  They&lt;br&gt;will still appear moist in the center.  Be careful not to overcook -- when cooled,&lt;br&gt;the cookies should be soft and chewy.  &lt;br&gt;
6.  While the cookies bake, prepare the filling.  Use a smal  bowl to dissolve the&lt;br&gt;salt in 2 teaspoons of very hot water.  Set this solution aside to cool.  &lt;br&gt;
7. Combine the marshmallow creme, shortening, powdered sugar, and vanilla in&lt;br&gt;a medium bowl and mix well with an electric mixer on high speed until fluffy.  Add&lt;br&gt;the cooled salt solution to the filling mixture and combine with the mixer.&lt;br&gt;
8. Assemble each creme pie by spreading the filling over one side of a cookie&lt;br&gt;(the flat side) and press another cookie on top, making a sandwich. Repeat for&lt;br&gt;the remaining cookies and filling.&lt;br&gt;
Makes 2 dozen creme pies.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;A name=369&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;       Lone Star Steakhouse Baked Sweet Potato&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      4    garnet yams&lt;br&gt;      3 T  granulated sugar&lt;br&gt;  1 1/2 t  cinnamon&lt;br&gt;    1/2 c  whipped butter&lt;br&gt;
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Bake yams for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. When&lt;br&gt;they are done, they will be very soft in the center, and you wil  see liquid&lt;br&gt;from the potato oozing out and charring. When the potato is sliced open,&lt;br&gt;the inside of the skin will be charred black from the caramelizing sugar in&lt;br&gt;the potato. This is a perfectly cooked potato.&lt;br&gt;
2. Combine the cinnamon and sugar in a small bowl.&lt;br&gt;
3. To serve, slice a potato down the center. Add two tablespoons of whipped&lt;br&gt;butter, then sprinkle some cinnamon/sugar over the top.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;A name=374&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;       M&amp;amp;M/Mars 3 Musketeers&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;      3 c  granulated sugar&lt;br&gt;    3/4 c  light corn syrup&lt;br&gt;    3/4 c  water&lt;br&gt;    1/8 t  salt&lt;br&gt;      3    egg whites&lt;br&gt;    1/3 c  semisweet chocolate chips&lt;br&gt;      2    bags milk chocolate chips&lt;br&gt;      1    (12-ounce bags)&lt;br&gt;
1.  In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine the sugar, corn syrup, water,&lt;br&gt;and salt.  Heat, stirring, to boiling, then continue to cook, using a candy&lt;br&gt;thermometer to monitor the temperature. &lt;br&gt;
2.  Beat the egg whites until they are stiff and form peaks.  Don't use a&lt;br&gt;plastic bowl for this. &lt;br&gt;
3.  When the sugar solution comes to 270 degrees F, or the soft-crack stage,&lt;br&gt;remove from the heat and pour the mixture in thin streams into the egg whites,&lt;br&gt;blending completely with a mixer set on low speed. &lt;br&gt;
4. Continue to mix until the candy begins to harden to the consistency of dough.&lt;br&gt;This may take as long as 20 minutes.  At this point, add the semisweet chocolate&lt;br&gt;chips.  Remember that the candy must already be at the consistency of dough&lt;br&gt;when you add the chocolate;  the nougat will thicken no more after the chocolate&lt;br&gt;is added. &lt;br&gt;
5.  When the chocolate is thoroughly blended and the nougat has thickened,&lt;br&gt;press it into a greased 9x9-inch pan. Refrigerate until firm, about 30  minutes. &lt;br&gt;6. With a sharp knife, cut the candy in half down the middle of the pan. Then cut&lt;br&gt;across into 7 segments to create a total of 14 bars. &lt;br&gt;
7. Melt the milk chocolate chips in the microwave for 2 minutes on half power,&lt;br&gt;stirring halfway through the heating time. Melt completely, but be careful not to&lt;br&gt;overheat. &lt;br&gt;
8. Resting a bar on a fork (and using your fingers if needed), dip each bar into&lt;br&gt;the chocolate to coat completely and place on wax paper. Cool till firm at room&lt;br&gt;temperature, 1 to 2 hours. &lt;br&gt;
Makes 14 candy bars.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;A name=375&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;       M&amp;amp;M/Mars Snickers Bar&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    1/4 c  light corn syrup&lt;br&gt;      2 T  butter,softened&lt;br&gt;      1 t  vanilla extract&lt;br&gt;    1/8 c  creamy peanut butter dash&lt;br&gt;           -salt&lt;br&gt;      3 c  powdered sugar&lt;br&gt;     35    unwrapped kraft caramels&lt;br&gt;      1 c  dry-roasted peanuts,Unsalted&lt;br&gt;     12 oz milk-chocolate chips&lt;br&gt;
With the mixer on high speed, combine the corn syrup, butter,&lt;br&gt;vanilla, peanut butter, and salt until creamy. Slowly add the powdered sugar.&lt;br&gt;When the mixture has the consistency of dough, remove it from the&lt;br&gt;bowl with your hands and press it into a lightly greased 9x9&amp;quot; pan.&lt;br&gt;Set in the refrigerator.&lt;br&gt;
Melt the caramels in a small pan over low heat.  When the caramel is&lt;br&gt;soft, mix in the peanuts.  Pour the mixture over the refrigerated&lt;br&gt;nougat in the pan.  Let this cool in the refrigerator.&lt;br&gt;
When the refrigerator mixture is firm, melt the chocolate over low&lt;br&gt;heat in a double boiler or in a microwave oven set on high for 2&lt;br&gt;minutes. Stir halfway through cooking time.&lt;br&gt;
When the mixture in the pan has hardened, cut into 2x1&amp;quot; sections.&lt;br&gt;
Set each chunk onto a fork and dip into the melted chocolate. Tap the&lt;br&gt;fork against the side of the bowl or pan to knock off any excess&lt;br&gt;chocolate. Then place the chunks on waxed paper to cool at room&lt;br&gt;temperature (less than 70 degrees.)  This could take several hours,&lt;br&gt;but the bars will set best this way.  You can speed up the process by&lt;br&gt;placing the bars in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.&lt;br&gt;
Makes:  2 dozen bars &lt;br&gt;

2.  Grill the faces of the hamburger bun in a hot skillet over medium heat.  Grill&lt;br&gt;until the buns are golden brown. Leave pan hot.  &lt;br&gt;
3.  Grill the frozen patty in the pan for 2-3 minutes per side. Sprinkle one side&lt;br&gt;with seasoned salt and ground black pepper.  &lt;br&gt;
4. Prepare the rest of the burger by first spreading the 2 teaspoons of ketchup on&lt;br&gt;the face of the top bun.  Follow the ketchup with the tablespoon of mayonnaise.&lt;br&gt;5.  Stack the onion onto the top bun next, followed by the pickles and lettuce.&lt;br&gt;Add the tomato slice to the top of the stack.  &lt;br&gt;
6. When the beef patty is done cooking, use a spatula to arrange it on the&lt;br&gt;bottom bun.  Turn the top of the burger over onto the bottom and serve.&lt;br&gt;

      4 oz breakfast sausage&lt;br&gt;      1 T  white onion,Minced&lt;br&gt;    1/2 T  mild green chilies,Minced&lt;br&gt;           -(canned)&lt;br&gt;      4    eggs,beaten&lt;br&gt;           salt&lt;br&gt;           pepper&lt;br&gt;      4    8-inch flour tortillas&lt;br&gt;      4 sl American cheese&lt;br&gt;           **On the side**&lt;br&gt;           salsa&lt;br&gt;
1.  Preheat a skillet over medium heat.  Crumble the sausage into the pan,&lt;br&gt;then add the onion.  Saute the sausage and onion for 3 to 4 minutes or until the&lt;br&gt;sausage is browned.  &lt;br&gt;
2.  Add the mild green chilies and continue to saute for 1 minute.  &lt;br&gt;
3.  Pour the beaten eggs into the pan and scramble the eggs with the sausage&lt;br&gt;and vegetables.  Add a dash of salt and pepper.&lt;br&gt;
4.  Heat up the tortillas by steaming them in the microwave in moist paper&lt;br&gt;towels or a tortilla steamer for 20 to 30 seconds.  &lt;br&gt;
5.  Break each slice of cheese in half and position two halves end-to-end in the&lt;br&gt;middle of each tortilla.  &lt;br&gt;

&lt;A name=393&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;b&gt;     Mcdonald's Filet-O-Fish&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
2 T Mayonnaise 2 t Sweet relish 2 t Minced onion pn Salt 2 Plain&lt;br&gt;hamburger buns 2 Mrs. Paul's breaded- Fish portions (square) 1 sl&lt;br&gt;American cheese&lt;br&gt;
1. In a small bowl, mix together the mayonnaise,relish,minced onion,&lt;br&gt;and salt and set aside. This is your tartar sauce. &lt;br&gt;
2. Lightly grill the faces of the buns. &lt;br&gt;
3. Cook the fish according to the package instructions. You can bake the fish,&lt;br&gt;but your sandwich will taste much more like the original if you fry it in oil. &lt;br&gt;
4. Divide the tartar sauce and spread it evenly on each of the top buns. &lt;br&gt;
5. Slice the cheese in half and place a piece on each of the bottom buns. &lt;br&gt;
6. Place the cooked fish on top of the cheese slice on each sandwich, and top&lt;br&gt;off the sandwiches with the top buns. &lt;br&gt;
7. Microwave each sandwich on high for 10 seconds.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;A name=394&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;       Mcdonald's French Fries&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      2 lg russet potatoes&lt;br&gt;   1 48    -ounce can shortening&lt;br&gt;           salt&lt;br&gt;
Recommended: 1/4-inch potato slicer&lt;br&gt;
1. Peel the potatoes, dry them and slice using a mandolin or other&lt;br&gt;slicer with a setting as close to 1/4-inch square strips as you've got. &lt;br&gt;
2. Rinse the fries in a large bowl filled with around 8 cups of cold&lt;br&gt;water. The water should become milky. Dump the water out and add another 8&lt;br&gt;cups of cold water plus some ice and let the fries sit for an hour.&lt;br&gt;
3. Spoon the shortening into your deep fryer and set it to 375 degrees.&lt;br&gt;On many fryers this is the highest setting.&lt;br&gt;
4. Remove the fries from the water and spread them out on a towel to&lt;br&gt;dry for 10-15 minutes. Don't let them sit much longer then this or they&lt;br&gt;will begin to turn brown.&lt;br&gt;
5. The oil should now be hot enough for the blanching stage. Split up&lt;br&gt;the fries and add them to the oil for 1 1/2 minutes at a time. Watch them&lt;br&gt;carefully to be sure they don't begin to brown. If they start to brown&lt;br&gt;on the edges, take 'em out. Remove the fries to paper towels to drain and&lt;br&gt;cool. When the fries have cooled, put them into a resealable bag or&lt;br&gt;covered container and freeze for 4 to 5 hours or until the potatoes are&lt;br&gt;completely frozen. As the fries freeze you can turn off the fryer, but turn it&lt;br&gt;back on and give it plenty of time to heat up before the final frying stage&lt;br&gt;for your fries.&lt;br&gt;
6. Split up the frozen fries and add one half at a time to the hot oil.&lt;br&gt;Fry for 4 1/2 to 6 minutes or until the fries have become a golden brown&lt;br&gt;color and are crispy on the outside when cool. The second batch may take a&lt;br&gt;tad longer than the first, since the oil may have cooled. Drain the fries&lt;br&gt;to paper towels and salt generously.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;A name=395&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;b&gt;   Mcdonald's Ham And Egg Breakfast Bagel Sandwich&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;           **Sauce **&lt;br&gt;      2 T  mayonnaise&lt;br&gt;      1 t  creamy dill mustard&lt;br&gt;           **other**&lt;br&gt;      4    eggs&lt;br&gt;      1 t  butter&lt;br&gt;           salt&lt;br&gt;           black pepper,Ground&lt;br&gt;      8    -ounces deli-sliced ham -(2-3 per,Slices -- sandwich)&lt;br&gt;      4    plain bagels&lt;br&gt;      8 sl Kraft Singles American cheese&lt;br&gt;
1.  First prepare the sauce by combining the mayonnaise with the&lt;br&gt;dill mustard in a small bowl.  Set this aside until you are ready to use it.&lt;br&gt;2. To prepare the eggs it's best to make one at a time in a small 6-inch&lt;br&gt;skillet.  If you have more than one of these small pans, you can save a&lt;br&gt;little time.  &lt;br&gt;3.  Beat an egg in a small bowl with a whisk until it is smooth, but not &lt;br&gt;foamy.  Add a pinch of salt and pepper to the egg. Heat a small 6-inch &lt;br&gt;skillet over low heat.  Add 1/4 teaspoon of butter to the pan. When the &lt;br&gt;butter has melted add the egg to the pan.  Swirl the pan so that the egg &lt;br&gt;spreads evenly.  As the egg begins to cook, use a spatula to pull&lt;br&gt;in a couple of the edges so that raw egg flows from the top onto the&lt;br&gt;hot pan.  Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, then fold over one of the edges of the&lt;br&gt;egg using a spoon or fork.  Fold it down about an inch.  Fold the opposite&lt;br&gt;end over as well.  Then fold the remaining two edges over, creating a smal&lt;br&gt;rectangular or square mini-omelette.  Flip the little omelette over and&lt;br&gt;turn off the heat.  &lt;br&gt;4.  Heat up the ham in a covered dish in the microwave for 1 minute.  &lt;br&gt;This will make it hot, and keep it from drying.   &lt;br&gt;5.Slice a bagel in half and place it with the faces up on a baking sheet.  &lt;br&gt;Grill the faces of the bagel halves in your oven set on broil until golden &lt;br&gt;brown. You may also use a toaster oven for this step, but be sure to &lt;br&gt;place the sliced bagel halves onto a small baking sheet or on aluminum foil.  &lt;br&gt;6. When the bagels are toasted, spread about 1/2 tablespoon of the sauce&lt;br&gt;onto the face of the top bagel half.  &lt;br&gt;7.  Place a slice of cheese onto the face of each bagel half.  &lt;br&gt;8.  Place the finished omelette onto the cheese on the bottom half of the&lt;br&gt;sandwich.  &lt;br&gt;9.  Place the ham onto the egg.  &lt;br&gt;10. Finish by flipping the top half of the sandwich over onto the bottom.  Heat&lt;br&gt;for 15 seconds in microwave if needed to warm.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;A name=396&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;       Mcdonald's Hot Apple &amp;amp; Cherry Pies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
4-6 c  vegetable oil (in fryer)&lt;br&gt;1 pk pillsbury apple or cherry&lt;br&gt;-turnover; in refrigerated section&lt;br&gt;
Preparation: &lt;br&gt;1. Unroll the Pillsbury turnover dough. You will have six 3'x3' pieces. You will use&lt;br&gt;four of them. Stretch them out to about 4'x5' rectangles. Do this on waxed paper.&lt;br&gt;2. Spread 1/2 of the pie filling on one dough, and the other half on another,&lt;br&gt;leaving about 1/2' of dough around edges. Clear a 3/4' space lengthwise down&lt;br&gt;the middle of both.  &lt;br&gt;3. Place the remaining two doughs on top of the two with the filling. Crimp the&lt;br&gt;edges. You'll have what looks like two giant pop-tarts.  &lt;br&gt;4. Cut both of them precisely down the middle, in that 3/4' space you created.&lt;br&gt;Crimp those two edges.  &lt;br&gt;5. Manipulate as needed to form an attractive, uniform shaped pie. They should&lt;br&gt;look like small burritos, only crimped around the edges.   &lt;br&gt;6. Place all four, flat on waxed paper, in the freezer. After about 45 minutes,&lt;br&gt;spray all sides of each pie with water mist. Return to the freezer for at least&lt;br&gt;another hour.  &lt;br&gt;7. Place in a freezer bag and sealfor future use, or get ready to deep-fry them.&lt;br&gt;
Cooking Your Pies &lt;br&gt;1. Pre-heat your deep fryer to 375. Also pre-heat your oven to warm.   &lt;br&gt;2. Quickly dip a frozen pie in cold water, making sure to immerse it entirely.   &lt;br&gt;3. Drop the pie into the hot oil. Be careful---it will most likely splatter. After all the&lt;br&gt;pies are in the fryer, place your spare fryer basket over the top. ('Sandwiching'&lt;br&gt;the pies between the two baskets.) This ensures the pies are fully submerged. It&lt;br&gt;is important that the pies are fully submerged or a good portion of it won't cook&lt;br&gt;correctly.&lt;br&gt;4. Cook 5-7 minutes. Check after 5 minutes---the color should be a golden&lt;br&gt;brown. The older the oil, the sooner the it will turn brown, and that may&lt;br&gt;give you a false reading. 6 minutes is generally right.  &lt;br&gt;5. After deep frying, carefully remove the cooked pies and drain for 1 minute on&lt;br&gt;paper towels. Then place directly on the oven rack in your warmed oven. Warm&lt;br&gt;for at least 10 minutes, and as long as 30 minutes.  &lt;br&gt;

First preheat pan over low heat.  Add 1/4 teaspoon ofbutter.  Add 1/2&lt;br&gt;teaspoon of minced green pepper along with 1/2 teaspoon  minced white onion&lt;br&gt;to the pan and saut for a couple minutes, or until softer.  &lt;br&gt;4.  Beat an egg in a small bowl with a whisk until it is smooth, but not foamy.&lt;br&gt;Add a pinch of salt and pepper to the egg.  Add the egg to the pan with the&lt;br&gt;vegetables.  Swirl the pan so that the egg spreads out. As the egg begins to&lt;br&gt;cook, use a spatula to pull in a couple of the edges so that raw egg flows around&lt;br&gt;from the top onto the hot pan.  Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, then fold over one of the&lt;br&gt;edges of the egg using a spoon or fork.  Fold it down about an inch.  Fold the&lt;br&gt;opposite end over as well. Then fold the remaining two edges over, creating a&lt;br&gt;smal  rectangular or square mini-omelet.  Flip the little omelets over and turn off&lt;br&gt;the heat.&lt;br&gt;5.  Press the sausage into four 2-ounce patties approximately the size of the&lt;br&gt;bagel.  Cook the sausage in a large skillet over medium heat until brown.  Drain&lt;br&gt;when done.  &lt;br&gt;6.  Slice a bagel in half and place it with the faces up on a baking sheet. Grill the&lt;br&gt;faces of the bagel halves in your oven set on broil until golden brown.  You may&lt;br&gt;also use a toaster oven for this step, but be sure to place the sliced bagel halves&lt;br&gt;onto a small baking sheet or on aluminum foil.  &lt;br&gt;7.  When the bagels are toasted, spread about 1/2 tablespoon of the sauce onto&lt;br&gt;the face of the top bagel half.  &lt;br&gt;8. Place a slice of American cheese onto the face of the top bagel half.  &lt;br&gt;9. Place a slice of Monterey Jack cheese over the face of the bottom bagel half.&lt;br&gt;10. Place a sausage patty on the cheese on the bottom bagel half.  &lt;br&gt;11. Place the finished omelet onto the sausage on the bottom half of the&lt;br&gt;sandwich.  &lt;br&gt;12.  Finish by flipping the top half of the sandwich over onto the bottom.  &lt;br&gt;Heat for 15 seconds in microwave if needed to warm.&lt;br&gt;

Add 1/4 teaspoon of butter to the pan.  When the butter has melted add&lt;br&gt;the egg to the pan. Swirl the pan so that the egg spreads evenly.  As the egg&lt;br&gt;begins to cook, use a spatula to pull in a couple of the edges so that raw egg&lt;br&gt;flows from the top onto the hot pan.  Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, then fold over one&lt;br&gt;of the edges of the egg using a spoon or fork.  Fold it down about an inch.&lt;br&gt;Fold the opposite end over as well.  Then fold the remaining two edges over,&lt;br&gt;creating a small rectangular or square mini-omelette.  Flip the little omelette over&lt;br&gt;and turn off the heat.  &lt;br&gt;6.  Slice a bagel in half and place it with the faces up on a baking sheet.  Grill the&lt;br&gt;faces of the bagel halves in your oven set on broil until golden brown.

When the bagels are toasted, spread about 1/2 tablespoon of the sauce onto&lt;br&gt;the face of the top bagel half.  &lt;br&gt;8.  Place a slice of cheese onto the face of each bagel half.&lt;br&gt;9.  Divide the meat into four portions and stack one portion onto the cheese on&lt;br&gt;the bottom bagel half.  &lt;br&gt;10.  Place the finished omelette onto the meat on the bottom half of the&lt;br&gt;sandwich.  &lt;br&gt;11.  Finish by flipping the top half of the sandwich over onto the bottom.

      1 c  all-purpose flour,Sifted&lt;br&gt;           (plus 1/2 cup &amp;amp;,Divided&lt;br&gt;           -reserved fo&lt;br&gt;           -- kneading and rolling)&lt;br&gt;      1 t  baking soda&lt;br&gt;    1/4 t  baking powder&lt;br&gt;    1/2 c  Kraft Macaroni &amp;amp; Cheese&lt;br&gt;           -Cheese Topp&lt;br&gt;           -- powder&lt;br&gt;           (or 2 packages dry cheese&lt;br&gt;           -powder fr&lt;br&gt;           -- boxes Kraft macaroni &amp;amp;&lt;br&gt;           -cheese)&lt;br&gt;      3 T  shortening&lt;br&gt;    1/3 c  buttermilk&lt;br&gt;    1/2 t  salt,(for tops, optional)&lt;br&gt;
1.  Sift together 1 cup flour, baking soda, baking powder and cheese powder in a&lt;br&gt;large bowl.  &lt;br&gt;2.  Cut in the shortening with a fork and knife with a crosswise motion until dough&lt;br&gt;is broken down into rice-size pieces. Mixture will still be very dry.  &lt;br&gt;3.  Stir in buttermilk with a fork until dough becomes very moist and sticky.  &lt;br&gt;4.  Sprinkle a couple tablespoons of the reserved flour over the dough and work&lt;br&gt;it in until it can be handled without sticking, then turn it out onto a floured board,&lt;br&gt;being sure to keep 1/4 cup of the reserve flour for later.  Knead the dough wel&lt;br&gt;for 60 to 90 seconds, and the flour is incorporated.  Wrap the dough in plastic&lt;br&gt;wrap and chill for at least one hour.  &lt;br&gt;5.  Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Spray a light coating of cooking spray on a&lt;br&gt;baking sheet.  &lt;br&gt;6.  Remove the dough from the refrigerator and use the remaining reserve flour&lt;br&gt;to dust a rolling surface.  Roll about one-third of the dough to just under 1/16th of&lt;br&gt;inch thick.  Trim the edges square (a pizza cutter or wheel works great for&lt;br&gt;this), then transfer the dough to a lightly greased baking sheet.  Use the rolling&lt;br&gt;pin to transfer the dough.  Simply pick up one end of the dough onto a rolling pin,&lt;br&gt;and roll the dough around the rolling pin.  Reverse the process onto the baking&lt;br&gt;sheet to transfer the dough.  &lt;br&gt;7.  Use a pizza cutter to cut across and down the dough, creating 1-inch square&lt;br&gt;pieces. Use the blunt end of a skewer or broken toothpick to poke a hole in the&lt;br&gt;center of each piece.  &lt;br&gt;8.  Sprinkle a very light coating of salt over the top of the crackers (crackers wil&lt;br&gt;already be quite salty) and bake for 8-10 minutes, mix the crackers around (so&lt;br&gt;those on the edge don't burn) and bake for another 3-5 minutes, or until some&lt;br&gt;are just barely turning a light brown.  Repeat the rolling and baking process with&lt;br&gt;the remaining dough.   &lt;br&gt;
Makes approximately 300 crackers.&lt;br&gt;

      2    egg whites&lt;br&gt;      1 c  plus 5 tablespoons sugar&lt;br&gt;      2 T  brown sugar&lt;br&gt;      2 T  molasses&lt;br&gt;  1 1/2 c  banana puree*&lt;br&gt;      3 T  shortening&lt;br&gt;    1/4 c  whole milk&lt;br&gt;    1/2 t  vanilla butter nut extract&lt;br&gt;  1 1/2 c  all-purpose flour&lt;br&gt;    1/2 t  salt&lt;br&gt;    1/4 t  baking soda&lt;br&gt;
1.  Preheat oven to 350. &lt;br&gt;2.  In a large bowl, whip the egg whites with an electric mixer until they become&lt;br&gt;thick.  Do not use a plastic bowl for this.  &lt;br&gt;3.  Add the sugar to the egg whites and continue to beat until the mixture forms&lt;br&gt;soft peaks.  &lt;br&gt;4.  Add the brown sugar, molasses, banana puree, shortening, milk and vanilla&lt;br&gt;butter nut flavoring to the mixture, beating after each addition.  &lt;br&gt;5.  In a separate bowl, combine the remaining ingredients.  &lt;br&gt;6.  While beating the wet mixture, slowly add the bowl of dry ingredients.  &lt;br&gt;7.  Lightly grease a 9x14-inch pan with a light coating of non-stick cooking spray.&lt;br&gt;Be sure to coat the sides as well as the bottom of the pan.  Dump about 3&lt;br&gt;tablespoons of sugar into the pan, then tilt and shake the pan so that a light layer&lt;br&gt;of sugar coats the entire bottom of the pan, and about halfway up the sides.&lt;br&gt;Pour out the excess sugar.  &lt;br&gt;8. Pour the batter into the pan, and spread it evenly around the inside of the&lt;br&gt;pan.  Sprinkle a light coating of sugar -- about two tablespoons -- over the entire&lt;br&gt;top surface of the batter.  Gently shake the pan from side-to-side to evenly&lt;br&gt;distribute the sugar over the batter.  Bake for 25-28 minutes or until the cake&lt;br&gt;begins to pull away from the sides of the pan.  &lt;br&gt;9.  Remove the cake from the oven and turn it out onto a cooling rack.  When&lt;br&gt;cake has cooled, place it onto a sheet of wax paper on a cutting board and slice&lt;br&gt;across the cake 6 times, creating 7 even slices. Next cut the cake lengthwise&lt;br&gt;twice, into thirds, creating a total of 21 snack bars.  When the bars have&lt;br&gt;completely cooled, store them in a resealable plastic bag or an airtight container.&lt;br&gt;

          **Chili**&lt;br&gt;
           **Burger**&lt;br&gt;
      1 lb ground beef,(not lean)*&lt;br&gt;
      3 lb beef,Ground&lt;br&gt;
    1/4 c  flour plus 1 1/4 cups flour&lt;br&gt;
      8    hamburger buns&lt;br&gt;
  1 1/3 c  beef broth&lt;br&gt;
     16 sl Kraft cheddar cheese Singles&lt;br&gt;
      4 c  water&lt;br&gt;
    1/2 c  onion,Diced&lt;br&gt;
      3 T  chili powder&lt;br&gt;
     32    hamburger pickles,(slices),- up to&lt;br&gt;
      2 T  grated,(and then chopped) carrot&lt;br&gt;
40&lt;br&gt;
      1 T  white vinegar&lt;br&gt;
      8 sl large beefsteak tomato -(1/2-inch&lt;br&gt;
      2 t  minced onion,Dried&lt;br&gt;
thick)&lt;br&gt;
      2 t  salt&lt;br&gt;
    1/4 c  yellow mustard&lt;br&gt;
      1 t  granulated sugar&lt;br&gt;      1 t  paprika&lt;br&gt;    1/4 t  garlic powder&lt;br&gt;
1.  Prepare the chili by first browning the meat in a large saucepan over medium heat.&lt;br&gt;Crumble the meat as it browns.  When the meat has been entirely cooked (7 to 10&lt;br&gt;minutes), pour the meat into a strainer over a large cup or saucepan.  Let the fat drip out&lt;br&gt;of the meat for about 5 minutes, then return the meat back to the first saucepan.  Cover&lt;br&gt;and set aside.  &lt;br&gt;2.  With the fat from the meat, we wil  now make a roux   Heat the drippings in a&lt;br&gt;saucepan over medium heat (you should have drained off around 1/2 cup of the stuff).&lt;br&gt;When the fat is hot, add 1/4 cup flour to the pan and stir well.  Reduce heat to&lt;br&gt;medium/low, and continue to heat the roux, stirring often until it is a rich caramel color.&lt;br&gt;This should take from 10 to 15 minutes.  Add the beef broth to the pan and stir. Remove&lt;br&gt;from heat.  &lt;br&gt;3.  Meanwhile, back at the other pan, add the water to the beef, then whisk in the&lt;br&gt;remaining 1 1/4 cups flour.  Add the roux/broth mixture and the other chili ingredients&lt;br&gt;and whisk until blended. Make sure your grated carrot is chopped up to the size of rice&lt;br&gt;before you add it.  &lt;br&gt;4.  Crank the heat up to medium/high.  Stir often until you see bubbles forming on the&lt;br&gt;surface of the chili.  Turn the heat down to medium/low, and continue to simmer for 15&lt;br&gt;to 20 minutes, or until thick. The chili should be calmly bubbling like lava as it simmers.&lt;br&gt;When it's done cooking, take the chili off the heat, cover it, and let it sit for 30 minutes to&lt;br&gt;an hour before using it on the burgers.  It should thicken to a tasty brown paste as it sits.&lt;br&gt;5.  To make your hamburgers, you'll first divide 3 pounds of hamburger into 16 portions&lt;br&gt;of 3 ounces each.  Grill the burgers on in a hot skillet or on an indoor griddle for 4 to 5&lt;br&gt;minutes per side or until done.  Use some salt and pepper on each patty.  &lt;br&gt;6.  Build the burgers by lightly toasting the faces of the hamburger buns.  Turn them&lt;br&gt;over into a hot skil et or a griddle on medium heat.  &lt;br&gt;7.  Place one patty onto the bottom bun.  &lt;br&gt;8.  Position two slices of cheese on the meat.  &lt;br&gt;9. Place another beef patty on the cheese.  &lt;br&gt;10.  Spoon about 1/3 cup of chili onto the beef patty.  &lt;br&gt;11.  Sprinkle about 1 tablespoon of diced onion onto the chili.  &lt;br&gt;12.  Arrange 4 to 5 pickle slices on the onion.  &lt;br&gt;13.  Place a thick slice of tomato on next.  &lt;br&gt;14.  Spread mustard over the face of the top bun and top off your hamburger by turning&lt;br&gt;this bun over onto the tomato.   &lt;br&gt;Makes 8 burgers.  (6 cups of chili.)&lt;br&gt;

Soften yeast in 1/2 cup warm water. Stir in sugar. Let stand 6&lt;br&gt;minutes or till bubbly. Meanwhile in large mixing bowl combine 1 cup&lt;br&gt;warm water with molasses, salt, oil and rye flour. Beat to smooth&lt;br&gt;batter. Then work in all-purpose flour till dough is smooth and no&lt;br&gt;longer sticky, very pliable and elastic. Knead a few minutes. Let&lt;br&gt;rise till doubled in greased bowl. Punch down. Shape into 2 large&lt;br&gt;round loaves placed a few inches apart on greased and cornmeal dusted&lt;br&gt;cookie sheet or fill 6 mini foil loaf pans, greased and dusted in&lt;br&gt;cornmeal, with the dough, dividing it evenly between these little&lt;br&gt;pans. Either way let loaves rise till doubled in warm place. Bake&lt;br&gt;large loaves 375 about 30 minutes or till crust makes hollow sound&lt;br&gt;when tapped with knuckles. For tiny loaves place pans on dry&lt;br&gt;ungreased cookie sheets, a few inches apart. When doubled in size,&lt;br&gt;bake at 375 for 20 minutes or till crust makes that hollow sound&lt;br&gt;when tapped. Bread freezes beautifully. &lt;br&gt;

Use an electric mixer to combine the mustard, honey, 1 1/2 t oil and&lt;br&gt;lemon juice in a small bowl.  Whip the mixture for about 30 seconds.&lt;br&gt;Pour about 2/3 of the marinade over the chicken breasts and marinate&lt;br&gt;them, covered, in the refrigerator for about two hours. Chill the&lt;br&gt;remaining marinade until later.  After the chicken has marinated,&lt;br&gt;preheat the oven to 375F and heat up an oven-proof frying pan large&lt;br&gt;enough to hold all four breasts and 1 T oil over medium heat.  (if&lt;br&gt;you don't have an oven-proof skillet, transfer the chicken to a&lt;br&gt;baking dish for baking). Sear the chicken in the pan for 3-4 minutes&lt;br&gt;per side or until golden brown. Remove the pan from the heat, but&lt;br&gt;keep the chicken in the pan.&lt;br&gt;
As the chicken is cooking, saute the sliced mushrooms in butter in a&lt;br&gt;smal  pan.  Brush each chicken breast with a little of the reserved&lt;br&gt;marinade (NOT the portion the chicken saoked in), being sure to save&lt;br&gt;a little extra that you can serve on the side later. Season the&lt;br&gt;chicken with salt, pepper and a dash of paprika.  Stack two pieces of&lt;br&gt;bacon, crosswise, on each chicken breast.  Spoon the sauteed&lt;br&gt;mushrooms onto the bacon, being sure to coat each breast evenly..&lt;br&gt;Sprinkle 1/4 c of Monterey Jack cheese onto each breast followed by&lt;br&gt;1/4 c of Cheddar. Bake the pan of prepared breasts for 7-10 minutes&lt;br&gt;or until the cheese is thoroughly melted and starting to bubble..&lt;br&gt;Sprinkle each breast with 1/2 t parsley before serving. Put extra&lt;br&gt;honey mustard marinade in a bowl to serve on the side.&lt;br&gt;

Mix together ingredients for dipping sauce, and chill. Divide the fries into half,&lt;br&gt;and use the other half later. Heat oil to 350 degrees. If you do not have a&lt;br&gt;thermostat, make sure the oil is hot enough, so that when you set a French fry in&lt;br&gt;there it will cook immediately. If the French fry sinks to the bottom, and barely&lt;br&gt;bubbles, it is not hot enough.&lt;br&gt;
Fry the potatoes in small batches, they are done when they are golden&lt;br&gt;brown, and float to the top of the skillet. ( I like to use a Dutch Oven). Be&lt;br&gt;sure to drain the potatoes on paper towels. You can keep them warm in the&lt;br&gt;oven while the other fries are done. When all French fries are done cooking&lt;br&gt;and drained place them onto a platter. Salt the French fries if you like,&lt;br&gt;and sprinkle on cheese and cooked bacon. Pop these back into a warm oven&lt;br&gt;until the cheese begins to melt.&lt;br&gt;

  1 1/4 c  pecans,Chopped&lt;br&gt;
      **other ingredients**&lt;br&gt;
           **Cinnamon Croutons**&lt;br&gt;
      4 c  vanilla ice cream&lt;br&gt;
      2 c  Bushman Bread,Cubed&lt;br&gt;
    1/2 c  caramel topping,(Smucker's&lt;br&gt;
    1/3 c  salted butter&lt;br&gt;
           -is good)&lt;br&gt;
      2 T  sugar&lt;br&gt;
  1 1/2 c  whipped cream&lt;br&gt;
    1/2 t  cinnamon        &lt;br&gt;
      4    fresh strawberries&lt;br&gt;
1.  For candied pecans, combine 1/2 cup granulated sugar, 2 tablespoons&lt;br&gt;water, 1 teaspoon butter, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon in a small saucepan&lt;br&gt;over medium heat.  Heat until mixture boils and all sugar granules are dissolved.  2.&lt;br&gt;Add chopped pecans to mixture and stir for 1 to 2 minutes over heat.  Be sure that all&lt;br&gt;pecans are well-coated.  &lt;br&gt;3.  Pour mixture onto a large plate and continue to stir until mixture hardens and begins&lt;br&gt;to break up.  You should be able to separate al  of the nuts.  &lt;br&gt;4.  For the croutons, preheat the oven to 300 degrees.  Pour the slice bread cubes onto&lt;br&gt;an ungreased cookie sheet and bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until the&lt;br&gt;bread has turned light brown.  Stir halfway through cooking time.  &lt;br&gt;5.  Melt the butter in a skil et over medium heat.  Pour baked croutons into the pan and&lt;br&gt;saute until the bread is well-coated with butter.  Combine the 2 tablespoons of sugar&lt;br&gt;and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon in a small bowl. Sprinkle this mixture over the croutons&lt;br&gt;while stirring so that the croutons are well-coated with cinnamon/sugar.  Remove&lt;br&gt;croutons from the heat and pour them onto a plate to cool.  &lt;br&gt;6.  Prepare apples by carefully mixing them with 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon and 1&lt;br&gt;tablespoon of brown sugar in a large bowl.  You want to be sure you don't stir hard&lt;br&gt;enough to break up the apples.  Microwave the apple for 1 to 2 minutes or until hot.  &lt;br&gt;7.  To assemble the dessert for serving, first roll four cup-size scoops of ice cream in the&lt;br&gt;pecan pieces.  You can do this step ahead of time if you like, keeping the pecan-&lt;br&gt;covered scoops in your freezer.  &lt;br&gt;8.  Place an ice cream scoop onto a small plate, then pour about a tablespoon of&lt;br&gt;caramel over the ice cream.  Dribble another tablespoon around the base of the ice&lt;br&gt;cream onto the plate.  &lt;br&gt;9.  Spread the hot apples around the base of the ice cream being sure to divide them&lt;br&gt;evenly amongst the four servings.  &lt;br&gt;10. Divide the croutons into four portions and sprinkle them on the apples around&lt;br&gt;the base of the ice cream scoop on each plate.  &lt;br&gt;11.  Spread a generous portion of whipped cream onto the top of each scoop of ice&lt;br&gt;cream.  &lt;br&gt;12.  Top off each dish with a fresh strawberry.  &lt;br&gt;

For the&lt;br&gt;batter, use an electric mixer to combine the beer, flour, 1/2 cup&lt;br&gt;coconut flakes, sugar, and salt in a medium sized bowl.  Mix well,&lt;br&gt;then cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour. Prepare your mamalade&lt;br&gt;sauce by combining all four ingredients in a small bowl. Cover and&lt;br&gt;refrigerate this for at least 1 hour as well. Prepare the shrimp by&lt;br&gt;deveining and peeling off the shel  back to the tail. Leave the last&lt;br&gt;segment of the shell plus the tailfins as a handle. When the batter&lt;br&gt;is ready, preheat oil in a deep pot or deep fryer to about 350. Use&lt;br&gt;enough oil to completely cover the shrimp. Pour the remainder of the&lt;br&gt;coconut into a shal ow bowl. Be sure the shrimp is dry before&lt;br&gt;battering.  Sprinkle each shrimp lightly with paprika before the next&lt;br&gt;step. Dip one shrimp at a time into the batter, coating generously.&lt;br&gt;Drop the battered shrimp into the coconut and roll it around so that&lt;br&gt;it is well coated. Fry 4 shrimp at a time for 2-3 minutes or until&lt;br&gt;the shrimp become golden brown. You may have to flip the shrimp over&lt;br&gt;halfway through cooking time. Drain on paper towels briefly before&lt;br&gt;serving with marmalade sauce on the side.&lt;br&gt;

1. Preheat your grill to high heat.&lt;br&gt;2. Make the remoulade sauce by mixing the ingredients together in a&lt;br&gt;small bowl. Cover and chill this sauce until you are ready to use it.&lt;br&gt;3. Prepare the shrimp seasoning by mixing the spices together in a&lt;br&gt;small bowl.&lt;br&gt;4. Remove the shell from the shrimp. Keep the last segment of the shell&lt;br&gt;and the tail. Remove the black vein that runs down the back of the shrimp.&lt;br&gt;Stick a skewer through the middle of each shrimp. Push them together on&lt;br&gt;the skewer so that they are 'spooning' each other.&lt;br&gt;5. Squeeze some fresh lemon juice over the cuddling shrimp.&lt;br&gt;6. Brush melted butter generously over the top of the shrimp.&lt;br&gt;7. Sprinkle a bit of the seasoning on next. Don't use a heavy coating&lt;br&gt;of seasoning&lt;br&gt;8. Place the shrimp onto your hot grill with the seasoning side down.&lt;br&gt;Brush some more butter over the other side of the shrimp -- the flames should&lt;br&gt;jump up from the butter. Sprinkle a light coating of seasoning over the shrimp (you&lt;br&gt;should have lots of seasoning left over).&lt;br&gt;9. After 3 minutes or so the face-down side of the shrimp should be browned&lt;br&gt;and showing some light charring. Flip the shrimp over and grill for an additional 2-3&lt;br&gt;minutes or until browned on the other side.&lt;br&gt;10. Remove the shrimp from the grill and slide them off the skewer onto a&lt;br&gt;slice of garlic butter coated bread.* Sprinkle with a pinch of fresh&lt;br&gt;parsley. &lt;br&gt;

1.  If using a bread machine, add all of the ingredients for the dough in&lt;br&gt;the exact order listed into the pan of your machine.  Set it on &amp;quot;knead&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;and when the machine begins to mix the dough, combine the food coloring&lt;br&gt;with 1/4 cup of water and drizzle it into the mixture as it combines.  After&lt;br&gt;the dough is created let it rest to rise for an hour or so.  Then remove it&lt;br&gt;from the pan and go to step #3.  &lt;br&gt;2.  If you are not using a bread machine, combine the flours, cocoa, sugar,&lt;br&gt;coffee and salt in large bowl.  Make a depression or &amp;quot;well&amp;quot; in the middle of the&lt;br&gt;dry mixture.  Pour the warm water into this &amp;quot;well,&amp;quot; then add the butter, honey and&lt;br&gt;yeast.  Combine the food coloring drops with 1/4 cup of water and add that to the&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;well.&amp;quot; Slowly mix the ingredients with a spoon, drawing the dry ingredients into&lt;br&gt;the wet. When you can handle the dough, begin to combine it by hand, kneading&lt;br&gt;the dough thoroughly for at least ten minutes, until it is very smooth and has&lt;br&gt;a consistent color.  Set the dough into a covered bowl in a warm place for&lt;br&gt;an hour, to allow it to rise.  &lt;br&gt;3.  When the dough has risen to about double in size, punch it down and divide it&lt;br&gt;into 8 even portions (divide dough in half, divide those halves in half, and then&lt;br&gt;once more).  Form the portions into tubular shaped loaves about 8 inches long&lt;br&gt;and 2 inches wide. Sprinkle the entire surface of the loaves with cornmeal and&lt;br&gt;place them on a cookie sheet, or two.  Cover the cookie sheet(s) with plastic&lt;br&gt;wrap and let the dough rise once more for another hour in a warm location.  &lt;br&gt;4. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Uncover the dough and bake it for 20-24&lt;br&gt;minutes in the hot oven.  Loaves should begin to darken slightly on top when&lt;br&gt;done. Serve warm with a sharp bread knife and butter on the side.  If you want&lt;br&gt;whipped butter, like you get at the restaurant, just use an electric mixer on high&lt;br&gt;speed to whip some butter until it's fluffy.&lt;br&gt;
 Makes 8 small loaves.&lt;br&gt;

1. Preheat 48 ounces of shortening (1 large can), or 6 to 10 cups of&lt;br&gt;vegetable oil (use the amount required by your fryer), to 350 degrees.&lt;br&gt;2. Make the spiced breading for your wings by combining the wing&lt;br&gt;coating ingredients (flour through clove) in a medium bowl. Stir well.&lt;br&gt;3. Dip each wing, one at a time into the breading. Give each one a&lt;br&gt;light coating of the stuff. Arrange the breaded wings on a plate and let them&lt;br&gt;sit uncovered in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes.&lt;br&gt;4. When the oil is hot, lower the wings into it. Fry for 7 to 10&lt;br&gt;minutes, or until the wings are brown.&lt;br&gt;5. While the wings are frying, mix the hot sauce and water together in&lt;br&gt;a small bowl.&lt;br&gt;6. When the wings are done, drain them for a moment on paper towels or&lt;br&gt;a rack. Drop the hot wings into a large plastic container with a lid.&lt;br&gt;Pour the sauce over the wings. Cover the container and shake it to coat the&lt;br&gt;wings with sauce.&lt;br&gt;7. Use tongs to remove the wings from the container.

 Special Sauce  ==================&lt;br&gt;
    Stir Fry Sauce  =================&lt;br&gt;
    1/4 c  sugar&lt;br&gt;
      2 T  soy sauce&lt;br&gt;
    1/2 c  water&lt;br&gt;
      2 T  dark brown sugar&lt;br&gt;
      2 T  soy sauce&lt;br&gt;
    1/2 t  rice vinegar&lt;br&gt;
      2 T  rice vinegar&lt;br&gt;
          sticks&lt;br&gt;
      2 T  ketchup&lt;br&gt;
=========================&lt;br&gt;
      1 T  lemon juice&lt;br&gt;
      1 c  fried maifun (rice sticks)&lt;br&gt;
    1/8 t  sesame oil&lt;br&gt;
  other ingredients  ==============&lt;br&gt;
  hot stuff  ======================&lt;br&gt;
      3 T  vegetable oil&lt;br&gt;
      1 T  chinese hot mustard&lt;br&gt;
      2    chicken breast fillets&lt;br&gt;
      2 t  water&lt;br&gt;
      1 c  water chestnuts,Minced&lt;br&gt;
      1    to 3 teaspoons garlic chili-paste&lt;br&gt;
    2/3 c  straw mushrooms,Canned&lt;br&gt;
  lettuce  ========================&lt;br&gt;
      3 T  green onion,Chopped&lt;br&gt;
      4    to 5 iceberg lettuce,Sliced-cups&lt;br&gt;
      1 t  garlic (1 clove),Minced&lt;br&gt;
1. Make the special sauce (for spooning over your lettuce wraps) by dissolving the 1/4&lt;br&gt;cup sugar in 1/2 cup water in a small bowl. Add 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 2 tablespoons&lt;br&gt;rice vinegar, 2 tablespoons ketchup, 1 tablespoon lemon juice and 1/8 teaspoon&lt;br&gt;sesame oiL Mix well and refrigerate this sauce until you're ready to serve the lettuce&lt;br&gt;wraps. Combine the 2 teaspoons water with the Chinese hot mustard and set this aside&lt;br&gt;as well. Eventually you will add your desired measurement of Chinese mustard and&lt;br&gt;garlic chili sauce to the special sauce mixture to pour over your lettuce wraps. In the&lt;br&gt;restaurant chain, skilled master&lt;br&gt;craftsmen prepare the sauce at your table the same way, depending on your&lt;br&gt;desired heat level. We'll talk more about that later.&lt;br&gt;2. To prepare the filling for your lettuce wraps, bring 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil to&lt;br&gt;high heat in a wok or large frying pan. Saute the chicken breasts for 4 to 5 minutes per&lt;br&gt;side or until done. Remove chicken from the pan to cool. Keep the oil in the pan and&lt;br&gt;keep the pan hot.&lt;br&gt;3. As the chicken cools be sure your water chestnuts and mushrooms have&lt;br&gt;been minced to about the size of small peas.&lt;br&gt;4. Prepare the stir fry sauce by mixing the soy sauce, brown sugar, and&lt;br&gt;rice vinegar together in a small bowl.&lt;br&gt;5. When you can handle the chicken, hack it up with a sharp knife so that no piece is&lt;br&gt;bigger than a dime. With the wok or pan still on high heat, add an additional tablespoon&lt;br&gt;of vegetable oil. Add the chicken, garlic, water chestnuts and black mushrooms to the&lt;br&gt;pan. Add the stir fry sauce to the pan and saute the mixture for a couple minutes then&lt;br&gt;serve it onto into a dish lined with a bed of fried rice noodles (maifun).&lt;br&gt;6. Serve chicken with a side of lettuce cups. Make these lettuce cups by slicing the top&lt;br&gt;off of a head of iceberg lettuce right through the middle of the head. Pull your lettuce&lt;br&gt;cups off of the outside of this slice.&lt;br&gt;7. Make the special sauce at the table by adding your desired number of mustard and&lt;br&gt;chili sauce to the special sauce blend: 1 teaspoon mustard and chili sauce for mild, 2&lt;br&gt;teaspoons each for medium and 3 teaspoons of each for hot. Stir well.&lt;br&gt;8. Assemble lettuce wraps by spooning filling into a lettuce cup, adding special sauce&lt;br&gt;over the top, folding the sucker up like a taco, then munching down upon it with reckless&lt;br&gt;abandon.&lt;br&gt;

1.  Pat out the ground beef until about the same diameter as the bun. If you like,&lt;br&gt;you can freeze this patty ahead of time to help keep the burger from falling apart&lt;br&gt;when you cook it.  &lt;br&gt;
2.  Brown or toast the faces of the top and bottom buns.  You can do this in a&lt;br&gt;frying pan over medium heat or by toasting them in the oven (or toaster oven).&lt;br&gt;
3.  As the buns are browning, grill the hamburger patty, either in a hot frying pan&lt;br&gt;over medium heat...or you can use a barbecue grill.  Salt the meat generously. &lt;br&gt;
4. Combine the ketchup, relish and mustard in a small bowl.  &lt;br&gt;
5.  When the meat is cooked to your liking, place it on the face of the bottom&lt;br&gt;bun.  &lt;br&gt;
6. Slather the sauce on the face of the top bun and place it onto the meat.&lt;br&gt;

1.  Combine all of the sauce ingredients -- except the corn starch and arrowroot -- in a&lt;br&gt;small saucepan over high heat.  Stir often while bringing mixture to a boil.  When sauce&lt;br&gt;reaches a boil, remove it from heat and al ow it to cool a bit, uncovered.  &lt;br&gt;2.  Slice chicken breasts into bite-size chunks.  Remove exactly 1 cup of the marinade&lt;br&gt;from the pan and pour it over the chicken in a large resealable plastic bag or other&lt;br&gt;container which allows the chicken to be completely covered with the marinade.&lt;br&gt;Chicken should marinate for at least a couple hours. Cover remaining sauce and leave it&lt;br&gt;to cool until the chicken is ready.  &lt;br&gt;3. When chicken has marinated, preheat 2-inches of vegetable oil in a wok or&lt;br&gt;skillet to 350 degrees.  &lt;br&gt;4.  Combine corn starch with arrowroot in a small bowl, then add 3 tablespoons of water.&lt;br&gt;Stir until corn starch and arrowroot have dissolved.  Pour this mixture into the sauce and&lt;br&gt;set the pan over high heat.  When sauce begins to bubble and thickens cover and&lt;br&gt;remove from heat.  &lt;br&gt;5.  Beat together the ice water and egg in a medium bowl. Add baking soda and salt.  &lt;br&gt;6.  Add 3/4 cup of the flour and stir with a fork just until the flour in blended into the&lt;br&gt;mixture.  The batter should still be lumpy. &lt;br&gt;7.  Sprinkle another 1/4 cup of flour on top of the batter and mix with only one or two&lt;br&gt;strokes.  Most of this flour wil  still floating on top of the mixture.  Put the remaining flour&lt;br&gt;(1/2 cup) into a medium bowl. &lt;br&gt;8.  Dip each piece of chicken first into the flour, then into the batter.  Let some of the&lt;br&gt;batter drip off and then slide the chicken into the oil.  Fry up to 1/2 of the chicken pieces&lt;br&gt;at a time for 3-4 minutes, or until golden brown.  Flip the chicken over halfway through&lt;br&gt;the cooking time.  Remove the chicken to a rack or paper towels to drain. &lt;br&gt;9.  As the chicken cooks, reheat the sauce left covered on the stove.  Stir occasionally.&lt;br&gt;10.  When all of the chicken is done, pour it into a large bowl, and cover with the&lt;br&gt;thickened sauce.  Stir gently until all of the pieces are wel  coated.&lt;br&gt;

Sprinkle yeast over warm water and stir in the sugar. Let stand&lt;br&gt;about 5 minutes or until very bubbly. Combine the remaining ingredients&lt;br&gt;with about half of the flour, beating to  a smooth batter. Beat in&lt;br&gt;the yeast mixture and then with a sturdy spoon  work in remaining&lt;br&gt;flour until you can toss it lightly on a floured surface  and knead&lt;br&gt;it until it feels elastic in texture. The kneading may require about&lt;br&gt;2/3 cup additional flour, that you will be coating your hand with as&lt;br&gt;you knead the dough. Don't let the dough become too stiff and yet you&lt;br&gt;don't want it to stick to your hands. Place it in a large plastic&lt;br&gt;food bag, which you can spray inside with Pam or wipe the inside of&lt;br&gt;it with oil  and place the ball of kneaded douogh in this to rise&lt;br&gt;until doubled in  bulk. Be sure the plastic bag is large enough that&lt;br&gt;it will permit the  dough to double without splitting the bag. You&lt;br&gt;can place the bag of dough  on a warm, sunny spot on the table or&lt;br&gt;kitchen counter which helps it to  raise quickly and if it's&lt;br&gt;summertime, place the bag of dough (with open  end sealed tightly&lt;br&gt;with tape) in your car with the windows up! When dough  has doubled,&lt;br&gt;punch it down and shape it to fit two 15&amp;quot; round pizza pans  that have&lt;br&gt;been greased and dusted in cornmeal. Add the sauce and topping&lt;br&gt;ingredients exactly in the order listed above, spreading each&lt;br&gt;ingredients evenly over the dough. Let this rise about 20 minutes in&lt;br&gt;a warm place and then bake at 450, about 20 to 25 minutes, putting&lt;br&gt;one pizza at a time on center rack of the preheated oven. If you&lt;br&gt;don't want a pizza-pizza and you  can only handle one of them, wrap&lt;br&gt;the second pizza in foil or plastic and  seal it with tape to lock&lt;br&gt;out all air. Freeze it before it rises the last  time. After letting&lt;br&gt;it thaw 30 minutes, you can bake as directed above.&lt;br&gt;:&lt;br&gt;:&lt;br&gt;: &lt;br&gt;:&lt;br&gt;:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;A name=535&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;       Red Lobster Bacon Wrapped Stuffed Shrimp&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
           --seasoning--&lt;br&gt;    1/4 t  salt&lt;br&gt;    1/4 t  paprika&lt;br&gt;           dash black pepper,Ground&lt;br&gt;           dash cayenne pepper&lt;br&gt;           dash allspice&lt;br&gt;           --dipping sauce--&lt;br&gt;    1/3 c  ranch dressing&lt;br&gt;    1/4 t  cilantro,Dried&lt;br&gt;      5    pieces bacon&lt;br&gt;      5 lg shrimp&lt;br&gt;      3 sl fresh jalapeno&lt;br&gt;      1 oz pepper jack cheese&lt;br&gt;
1. Preheat oven to broil.&lt;br&gt;2. Make the seasoning blend by combining the ingredients in a small bowl. Set&lt;br&gt;this aside.&lt;br&gt;3. Make the dipping sauce by combining the ranch dressing with cilantro in a&lt;br&gt;medium bowl.&lt;br&gt;4. Cook the bacon in a frying pan over medium/high heat, but don't cook it all the&lt;br&gt;way to crispy. You want undercooked bacon that, when cool, will easily wrap&lt;br&gt;around the shrimp. Cook the bacon about 3 minutes per side, and don't let it&lt;br&gt;brown. When the bacon is done lay it on paper towels to drain and cool. &lt;br&gt;5. Shell the shrimp, leaving the last segment of the shell and the tail. Remove&lt;br&gt;the dark vein from the back of the shrimp, and then cut down into the back of the&lt;br&gt;shrimp, without cutting all the way through, so that the shrimp is nearly butterflied&lt;br&gt;open. This will make a pocket for the pepper and cheese.&lt;br&gt;6. Pour 1 cup of water into a small bowl. Add the shrimp and jalapeno peppers&lt;br&gt;and microwave for 60 to 90 seconds. Shrimp should be starting to firm up and&lt;br&gt;change color. Immediately pour the water out of the bowl, remove the jalapeno&lt;br&gt;slices and pour cold water over the shrimp. Place the the shrimp and jalapeno&lt;br&gt;pepper slices onto paper towels to drain off excess water.&lt;br&gt;7. Build the appetizer by cutting the jalapeno slices in half and removing the&lt;br&gt;seeds. You should now have 6 jalapeno slices -- you'll  need 5 of these. Place&lt;br&gt;one slice into the slit on the back of a shrimp.  Cut an inch-long chunk of cheese&lt;br&gt;(about 1/4-inch thick), and place it on the jalapeno slice. Wrap a piece of bacon&lt;br&gt;around the shrimp, starting where the cheese is. Start wrapping with the thinnest&lt;br&gt;end of the bacon. Go 1 1/2 times around the shrimp and then cut of the excess&lt;br&gt;bacon and slide a skewer  through the shrimp, starting with the end where the&lt;br&gt;cheese is and piercing the cut end of the bacon on the other side. Repeat with&lt;br&gt;the remaining shrimp and slide them onto the skewer with the tails facing the&lt;br&gt;same direction.&lt;br&gt;8. Put the skewer onto a baking sheet or broiler pan and sprinkle a very light&lt;br&gt;coating of the seasoning blend over the shrimp, then broil for 3 to 4 minutes or&lt;br&gt;until the bacon begins to brown and the cheese begins to ooze. Serve over a&lt;br&gt;bed of rice if desired. .&lt;br&gt;

Sprinkle the parsley over the top of the dough.  Be  sure the dried parsley&lt;br&gt;flakes are crushed fine.  You can easily crush the flakes in a smal  bowl with your&lt;br&gt;thumb and forefinger.  &lt;br&gt;5.  Sprinkle the crab over the top of the dough.  &lt;br&gt;6.  Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the crab.  Don't go all of the way to the&lt;br&gt;edge of the dough  leave a margin of a half-inch or so around the edge.  &lt;br&gt;7.  Bake for 14-16 minutes or until the cheese on top begins to slightly brown.  &lt;br&gt;8.  Combine the remaining butter with the garlic powder and brush it over the top&lt;br&gt;of the bake as soon as it comes out of the oven.  Slice it like a pizza into 8&lt;br&gt;pieces and serve hot.   &lt;br&gt;
Makes 8 pieces.&lt;br&gt;

*You may use all-purpose (regular) flour, however biscuits will not&lt;br&gt;rise much and have a denser texture; flavors should be about&lt;br&gt;identical. **Can substitute 3 packets of Sweet &amp;amp; Low for the sugar.&lt;br&gt;Use the cheese in the gold cardboard container. Original recipe does&lt;br&gt;not say, but I would think you will want to shred it.&lt;br&gt;
In a 1 1/2 qt mixing bowl combine the milk, mayo, sugar, and flour.&lt;br&gt;Beat on high speed with electric mixer for almost a minute, until&lt;br&gt;smooth and completely combined. Using a rubber bowl scraper, streak&lt;br&gt;the dough with the cheese. Batter should NOT be thin enough to pour;&lt;br&gt;if necessary, add only enough additional flour so batter wil  &amp;quot;drop&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;from spoon. Drop batter into 10 paper-lined muffin tins, or a greater&lt;br&gt;number of tiny muffin cups. (Muffins tend to triple in size when&lt;br&gt;baked; fill lightly.) Melt butter; mix in garlic, and brush tops of&lt;br&gt;dough. You may shake 1 tsp additional cheese on each muffin if you&lt;br&gt;wish. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until golden. Cool in pan on rack&lt;br&gt;for 30 minutes.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;A name=553&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;       Reese's Peanut Butter Cups&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
     12    paper muffin cups&lt;br&gt;           One 12-ounce pkg. milk&lt;br&gt;           -chocolate ch&lt;br&gt;      1 c  reduced-fat peanut butter&lt;br&gt;    1/2 c  powdered sugar&lt;br&gt;    1/4 t  salt&lt;br&gt;
1.  Cut the top half off of the muffin cups so that they are shallower.  &lt;br&gt;
2. Pour the chocolate chips into a glass bowl and melt them in the microwave:&lt;br&gt;Microwave at 50% power for 2 minutes.  Stir the chips gently, and let them sit for&lt;br&gt;a minute or so.  If the chocolate needs more melting, microwave those chippies&lt;br&gt;again at half power for 30 seconds.  Stir gently. Continue the process, stirring&lt;br&gt;gently as you go.  But be very careful not to overcook the chocolate or it'll seize&lt;br&gt;up on you&lt;br&gt;3.  Using a teaspoon, spoon a portion of the chocolate into the middle of a muffin&lt;br&gt;cup.  Draw the chocolate up the edges of the cup with the back of the spoon.&lt;br&gt;Coat the entire inside of the muffin cup with chocolate and place it into a muffin&lt;br&gt;tin.  Repeat with the remaining muffin cups and then put the whole muffin tin in&lt;br&gt;the fridge so that the chocolate hardens.  &lt;br&gt;4.  Combine the reduced-fat peanut butter, powdered sugar and salt in a medium&lt;br&gt;bowl.  &lt;br&gt;5.  When the chocolate in the muffin cups has hardened, pop the sweetened&lt;br&gt;peanut butter into the microwave oven on full power for 1 minute.  This will&lt;br&gt;soften up the peanut butter so that it easily flows into the cups.  &lt;br&gt;6.  Spoon a small portion of peanut butter into each of the chocolate-coated&lt;br&gt;cups.  Leave room at the top for an additional layer of chocolate, which we'll add&lt;br&gt;later.  Pop the candy back in the refrigerator to harden the peanut butter.  This&lt;br&gt;should take an hour or so.  &lt;br&gt;7.  When the peanut butter filling has hardened, re-melt the chocolate chips in&lt;br&gt;the microwave on half power for 30 to 60 seconds. Use a teaspoon to spread a&lt;br&gt;layer of chocolate over the top of each candy. Chill the candy once again to set&lt;br&gt;up the chocolate.  &lt;br&gt;
Makes 12 candies.&lt;br&gt;

Sprinkle a light coating of salt and a more generous portion of coarse&lt;br&gt;pepper over the top and bottom of each rack. Wrap the ribs in aluminum foil and&lt;br&gt;bake in a preheated 300 degree oven for 2 1/2 hours. &lt;br&gt;2. As the ribs cook, make the sauce by heating the oil in a medium saucepan&lt;br&gt;over medium/high heat. Saut the onions for 5 minutes or until they start to brown.&lt;br&gt;Add the remaining ingredients and bring mixture to a boil then reduce heat and&lt;br&gt;simmer for 1 1/4 hours, uncovered, or until sauce thickens. Remove from heat&lt;br&gt;and set aside until the ribs are ready. Preheat your barbecue grill.&lt;br&gt;3. When ribs are finished in the oven, the meat should have pul  back about&lt;br&gt;1/2-inch from the cut-ends of the bones. Remove the ribs from the oven, let them&lt;br&gt;sit for 10 minutes or so, then remove the racks from the foil and put them on the&lt;br&gt;grill. Grill the ribs for 3 to 4 minutes per side. They should be slightly charred in a&lt;br&gt;few spots when they're finished. Brush barbecue sauce on the ribs while they're&lt;br&gt;grilling, just before you serve them. Don't add the sauce too early or it will burn.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;A name=560&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;       Roadhouse Grill Roadhouse Cheese Wraps&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      8    thin monterey jack,Slices&lt;br&gt;           -cheese&lt;br&gt;      8    thin cheddar cheese,Slices&lt;br&gt;      1    jalapeno pepper,seeded and&lt;br&gt;           -diced&lt;br&gt;      1 t  fresh chives,Minced&lt;br&gt;      4 lg spring roll wrappers&lt;br&gt;      1    egg,Beaten&lt;br&gt;      6 c  vegetable oil,up to 10&lt;br&gt;           **On the side**&lt;br&gt;           Marinara,(pasta) sauce&lt;br&gt;
1.  Use a sharp knife to make 8 thin slices each from the end of standard-size&lt;br&gt;hunks of cheddar and monterey jack cheeses.  &lt;br&gt;2.  Arrange 2 slices of cheddar and 2 slices of jack on your hand, then sprinkle&lt;br&gt;about 1 teaspoon of diced jalapeno on top of the cheese.  Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon&lt;br&gt;of minced chives on next.  Sandwich the peppers and chives between the&lt;br&gt;cheese and roll it al  up.  Fold the cheese and squeeze it all together so that&lt;br&gt;the peppers and chives are well sealed into the middle of the cheeses.&lt;br&gt;3. Lay a spring roll wrapper with one corner pointing away from you. Arrange&lt;br&gt;the cheese lengthwise on the center of the wrapper. &lt;br&gt;4.  Fold one of the side corners over the cheese filling.  Brush a little beaten egg&lt;br&gt;on the tip of the other side corner and fold it over the first corner so that it sticks.&lt;br&gt;Brush some beaten egg on the corner pointing away from you. Fold the bottom&lt;br&gt;corner up and over the filling.  Roll the wrapper up, keeping it tight, until it rolls&lt;br&gt;over the top corner with the egg on it.  It should stick.  Repeat with the remaining&lt;br&gt;rolls, then cover them all and chill for at least 30 minutes.  This will be long&lt;br&gt;enough to heat up the oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees.  &lt;br&gt;5.  When the oil is hot, fry the rolls for 2 1/2 to 3 minutes or until the outside is&lt;br&gt;golden brown. Drain the rolls on a rack or paper towels for 2 minutes before&lt;br&gt;serving with your favorite marinara sauce on the side for dipping.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;A name=561&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;       Rock Candy For Kids&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      1    2 c granulated sugar&lt;br&gt;      1    heavy cord&lt;br&gt;      1    1 c water&lt;br&gt;
The book says to put one cup of water into a small saucepan, pour 2&lt;br&gt;cups of granulated sugar into the water, heat the water and sugar on&lt;br&gt;the stove over a medium heat, continue stirring until the sugar&lt;br&gt;melts, keep adding sugar and stirring until it melts, stop adding&lt;br&gt;sugar when you see that it will no longer dissolve in the water (that&lt;br&gt;is until you see sugar lying on the bottom of the saucepan). Remove&lt;br&gt;the pot from the stove, let the liquid cool until it is just warm.&lt;br&gt;Pour the liquid into a clean glass jar. Tie one end of a piece of&lt;br&gt;heavy cord around the middle of a pencil. Place the pencil over the&lt;br&gt;top of the glass jar letting the cord fall into the liquid. Crystals&lt;br&gt;will begin to form in a few hours. The next day, remove the cord from&lt;br&gt;the jar, pour the sugar liquid back into the saucepan, reheat and&lt;br&gt;cool it just as you did before. Pour the liquid back into the jar and&lt;br&gt;reinsert the cord with the crystals into it. More crystals will form.&lt;br&gt;If you repeat this procedure every day the crystal candy will grow&lt;br&gt;bigger and bigger. When it has reached a size that pleases you, snip&lt;br&gt;off any excess string and enjoy. &lt;br&gt;

1/2 lb.    round beef 2 t ablespoons&lt;br&gt;-al -purpose flour 1 1/2&lt;br&gt;
1.  In a medium bowl, combine the ground beef with the flour, chili powder,&lt;br&gt;salt, dried onion, paprika, garlic powder and onion powder.  Use your hands to&lt;br&gt;thoroughly incorporate everything into the ground beef.  &lt;br&gt;
2. Preheat a skillet over medium heat.  and add the ground beef mixture to the&lt;br&gt;pan along with the water.  Brown the beef mixture for 5-6 minutes, using a&lt;br&gt;wooden spoon or spatula to break up the meat as it cooks.  &lt;br&gt;
3.  Heat oil or Crisco shortening in a frying pan over medium-high heat.  If oil&lt;br&gt;begins to smoke, it is too hot.  When oil is hot, fry each tortilla for about 30-&lt;br&gt;45 seconds per side and set aside on paper towels.  When frying each tortilla,&lt;br&gt;be sure to pop any bubbles that form so that tortilla lays flat in oil. Tortillas should&lt;br&gt;become golden brown.  &lt;br&gt;
4.  Heat up refried beans in a small pan over the stove or in the microwave.&lt;br&gt;Preheat oven to 400 degrees.&lt;br&gt;
5. When meat and tortillas are done, stack each pizza by first spreading about&lt;br&gt;1/3 cup refried beans on the face of one tortilla.  Next spread 1/4 to 1/3 cup of&lt;br&gt;meat, then another tortilla.  Coat your pizzas with two tablespoons of salsa on&lt;br&gt;each then split up the tomatoes and stack them on top.  Next divide up the&lt;br&gt;cheese, onions and olives, stacking in that order.&lt;br&gt;
6.  Place pizzas in your hot oven for 8-12 minutes or until cheese on top is&lt;br&gt;melted.  &lt;br&gt;
Makes 4 pizzas.  &lt;br&gt;

      2 lb chuck,Ground&lt;br&gt;      1 c  onion -- chop&lt;br&gt;      1    green pepper -- chop&lt;br&gt;      1 t  mustard seeds&lt;br&gt;      3 T  beef bouil on powder -- or&lt;br&gt;      1 t  chili powder&lt;br&gt;    1/8 t  tabasco&lt;br&gt;      1 t  cumin powder&lt;br&gt;  1 1/2 c  bottled chili sauce&lt;br&gt;    1/3 c  sweetpickle relish&lt;br&gt;      1 sm can tomato paste&lt;br&gt;      6 oz water tomato paste can&lt;br&gt;      3 T  dark molasses&lt;br&gt; 10 1/2 oz beef broth&lt;br&gt;      1    hot fried taco shells&lt;br&gt;      1    lettuce -- shred&lt;br&gt;      1    monterey jack cheese-grate&lt;br&gt;
Pack beef into ungreased 10&amp;quot; skillet on medium heat. Cover and let&lt;br&gt;simmer, reducing to low heat after 5 minutes. You don't really want&lt;br&gt;to overbrown the beef, but to allow some moisture to combine with the&lt;br&gt;natural fat in the chuck to create a broth while it simmer. Depending&lt;br&gt;on the percentage of fat content in the beef, I'd let it steam like&lt;br&gt;this for about 12-15 minutes. Turn off heat. Drain liquid from beef&lt;br&gt;into blender with HALF of the beef. With on/off speed blend this&lt;br&gt;mixture until it resembles a brick-layer's mortar. To the mixture of&lt;br&gt;pulvarized beef and the remaining half which you did not put into the&lt;br&gt;blender, add onion, green pepper, mustard seed, bouillon powder and&lt;br&gt;chili powder. Stir in hotpepper sauce, cumin powder, chili sauce,&lt;br&gt;sweet pickle relish, tomato paste, water, molasses and beef broth.&lt;br&gt;(If you like a thinner sauce, add more beef broth). Simmer this&lt;br&gt;uncovered, stirring frequently to prevent scorching or use your slow&lt;br&gt;cooker on &amp;quot;high&amp;quot; for about 2 hours. On top of the range, simmer 1&lt;br&gt;hour, adding additional liquid as necessary tokeep sauce consistency.&lt;br&gt;Spoon it into the fried taco shells. Top it off  with lettuce, grated&lt;br&gt;cheese and Taco 5 Alarm Sauce. &lt;br&gt;

Preheat the oven to 350.  Make the cupcakes according to the directions on the&lt;br&gt;box.  While the cupcakes bake, make the chocolate and/or butter cream icings.&lt;br&gt;Chocolate Icing--In a mixing bowl, combine the butter with the chocolate chips&lt;br&gt;melted in a microwave set on high for 30 to 45 seconds. Blend in the vanilla, milk&lt;br&gt;and powdered sugar and beat with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy.&lt;br&gt;Butter cream Icing--Combine all the ingredients in a mixing bowl and beat until&lt;br&gt;smooth. If you're making the filled cupcakes, combine the ingredients for the&lt;br&gt;filling in another mixing bowl and beat until fluffy. When the cupcakes are cool,&lt;br&gt;complete each by following these directions. CHOCOLATE-ICED: First spread a&lt;br&gt;layer of chocolate frosting on each cupcake. Then, using a pastry bag with a&lt;br&gt;small, round tip, draw a single straight line of buttercream icing down the middle&lt;br&gt;of the chocolate icing.  BUTTERCREAM-ICED:  First spread a layer of&lt;br&gt;buttercream icing evenly over the top of each cupcake. Then, using a pastry bag&lt;br&gt;with a small round tip, draw a straight line of chocolate icing down the middle of&lt;br&gt;the buttercream icing. CREME-FILLED: If you want the cupcakes filled you need&lt;br&gt;to do it before you frost them. Use a toothpick or skewer to make a hole in the&lt;br&gt;top of the unfrosted cupcake. Stick the toothpick into the middle of the cupcake&lt;br&gt;and then swirl it around to carve out a cavity in the middle of the cake. This is&lt;br&gt;where the filling will go. Use a pastry bag to inject about 1 tsp of filling into each&lt;br&gt;cupcake, to fill the hole.   When you ice your cupcakes, the icing will neatly hide&lt;br&gt;the hole you made.&lt;br&gt;

Measure 3 quarts (12 cups) of the stock into a large sauce pan or&lt;br&gt;cooking pot.  If you don't have enough stock, add enough water to make 3&lt;br&gt;quarts.&lt;br&gt;4.  Add potatoes, bring mixture to a boil, then add 1/2 of the crab and&lt;br&gt;the remaining ingredients to the pot and bring it back to boiling.  Reduce&lt;br&gt;heat and simmer for 4 hours, uncovered until it reduces by about half&lt;br&gt;and starts to thicken.  Add the remaining crab and simmer for another hour&lt;br&gt;until the soup is very thick.   &lt;br&gt;

&lt;A name=629&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;b&gt;    The Soup Nazi's Mexican Chicken Chili&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
      1 lb chicken breast fillets,(4&lt;br&gt;           -fillets)&lt;br&gt;      1 T  olive oil&lt;br&gt;     10 c  water&lt;br&gt;      2 c  chicken stock&lt;br&gt;    1/2 c  tomato sauce&lt;br&gt;      1    potato,peeled &amp;amp; chopped&lt;br&gt;      1 sm onion,diced&lt;br&gt;      1 c  yellow corn,Frozen&lt;br&gt;    1/2    carrot,sliced&lt;br&gt;      1    celery stalk,diced&lt;br&gt;      1 c  diced tomatoes,Canned&lt;br&gt;      1    15-ounce can red kidney&lt;br&gt;           -beans,plus liquid&lt;br&gt;    1/4 c  diced pimento,Canned&lt;br&gt;      1    jalapeno,diced&lt;br&gt;    1/4 c  Italian parsley,Chopped&lt;br&gt;      1    clove garlic,minced&lt;br&gt;  1 1/2 t  chili powder&lt;br&gt;      1 t  cumin&lt;br&gt;    1/4 t  salt&lt;br&gt;      1 ds cayenne pepper&lt;br&gt;      1 ds basil&lt;br&gt;      1 ds oregano&lt;br&gt;           **On the side**&lt;br&gt;           Sour cream&lt;br&gt;      1 pn Italian parsley,Chopped&lt;br&gt;
1.  Saut the chicken breasts in the olive oil in a large pot over medium/high heat.&lt;br&gt;Cook the chicken on both side until done -- about 7- 10 minutes per side.  Cool&lt;br&gt;the chicken until it can be handled.  Do not rinse the pot. &lt;br&gt;2.  Shred the chicken by hand into bite-sizes pieces and place the pieces back&lt;br&gt;into the pot.  &lt;br&gt;3.  Add the remaining ingredients to the pot and turn heat to high.  Bring mixture&lt;br&gt;to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 4-5 hours.  Stir mixture often so that&lt;br&gt;many of the chicken pieces shred into much smaller bits.  Chili should reduce&lt;br&gt;substantially to thicken and darken (less orange, more brown) when done.  &lt;br&gt;4.  Combine some chopped Italian parsley with sour cream and serve it on the&lt;br&gt;side for topping the chili, if desired.   &lt;br&gt;

1.  Combine mint chocolate chips with shortening in a large microwave safe&lt;br&gt;glass or ceramic bowl.  Heat on 50% power for 2 minutes, stir (with a plastic or&lt;br&gt;wooden spoon), then heat for an additional minute.  Stir once again, and if&lt;br&gt;chocolate is not a smooth consistency, continue to zap in microwave in 30&lt;br&gt;second intervals until smooth.  &lt;br&gt;2.  Use a fork to dip each wafer in the chocolate, tap the fork on the edge of the&lt;br&gt;bowl so that the excess chocolate runs off, and then place the cookies side-by-&lt;br&gt;side on a wax paper lined baking sheet.  Refrigerate until firm.  &lt;br&gt;

&lt;A name=631&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;b&gt;     Three Ingredient Muffin Bread&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
     12 oz 7-up&lt;br&gt;      2    eggs&lt;br&gt;      4 c  bisquick baking mix&lt;br&gt;
Use wire whisk to beat 7-UP &amp;amp; eggs about 5 or 6 times &amp;amp; dump in&lt;br&gt;biscuit mix, stirring with sturdy spoon only till it is completely&lt;br&gt;moistened. Batter will be a bit lumpy.  Pour into a greased 9&amp;quot; metal&lt;br&gt;bread loaf pan. Let stand 10 minutes.  Bake at 400 degrees F. nearly&lt;br&gt;an hour or until it  tests done as suggested in the Two Ingredient Biscuit&lt;br&gt;Bread recipe.&lt;br&gt;
Options:  Because the bread has very little flavor of its own, you&lt;br&gt;may add 1 tablespoon of any flavoring or extract to the 7-UP when you&lt;br&gt;beat in the eggs.  OR  you can add 1 tsp of any powdered spice --&lt;br&gt;such as nutmeg or cinnamon.&lt;br&gt;
Blueberries in the batter makes a lovely tea bread, if you will stir&lt;br&gt;into the batter before you let it stand those 10 minutes -- 1 cup&lt;br&gt;frozen (unthawed)  blueberries -- having added the flavoring or&lt;br&gt;extract of your choice -- or even bottled grated orange or lemon peel&lt;br&gt;in place of the spice.  Bake as directed in recipe above.&lt;br&gt;

1.  Preheat oven to 400 degrees and bake the potatoes or 1 hour or until&lt;br&gt;done.  When potatoes have cooked remove them from the oven to cool.  &lt;br&gt;2. As potatoes cool prepare soup by melting butter in a large saucepan, and&lt;br&gt;saut onion until light brown.  Add the flour to the onions and stir to make a roux.&lt;br&gt;3.  Add stock, water, cornstarch, mashed potatoes, and spices to the pot and&lt;br&gt;bring to a boil.  Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.&lt;br&gt;4. Cut potatoes in half lengthwise and scoop out contents with a large spoon.&lt;br&gt;Discard skin.

Add chopped baked potato and half-and-half to the saucepan, bring soup&lt;br&gt;back to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer the soup for another 15 minutes or&lt;br&gt;until it is thick.  &lt;br&gt;6. Spoon about 1 1/2 cups of soup into a bowl and top with about a tablespoon&lt;br&gt;of shredded cheddar cheese, a half tablespoon of crumbled bacon and a&lt;br&gt;teaspoon or so of chopped green onion.  Repeat for remaining servings.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;A name=635&gt;&lt;/a&gt;       &lt;b&gt;Tony Roma's Ribs Clone&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
4 lb baby back pork ribs&lt;br&gt;:          barbecue sauce for coating&lt;br&gt;1 c  ketchup&lt;br&gt;1 c  vinegar&lt;br&gt;1/2 c  dark corn syrup&lt;br&gt;2 ts sugar&lt;br&gt;1/2 ts salt&lt;br&gt;1/4 ts garlic powder&lt;br&gt;1/4 ts onion powder&lt;br&gt;1/4 ts Tabasco sauce&lt;br&gt;
Ribs: When you buy ribs at the butcher counter, you often get a full&lt;br&gt;rack of ribs that won't fit on a plate. Usually you have to cut these&lt;br&gt;long racks in half to get the perfect serving size (about 4 to 6&lt;br&gt;bones per half rack.) You'll get 4 such half racks from 2 full racks&lt;br&gt;of ribs.&lt;br&gt;
Preheat the oven to 300 F.  Tear off 4 pieces of aluminum foil that&lt;br&gt;are roughly 6 inches longer than the ribs.  Coat the ribs, front and&lt;br&gt;back, with the barbecue sauce. Place a rack of ribs, one at a time,&lt;br&gt;onto a piece of foil lengthwise and wrap it tightly.&lt;br&gt;
Place the ribs into the oven, with the seam of the foil wrap facing&lt;br&gt;up. Cook for 2 to 2 1/2 hours or until you see the meat of the ribs&lt;br&gt;shrinking back from the cut ends of the bones by about 1/2 inch. This&lt;br&gt;long cooking time will ensure that the meat is tender.&lt;br&gt;
Toward the end of the cooking time, prepare the barbecue grill.&lt;br&gt;Remove the ribs from the foil and smother them with additional&lt;br&gt;barbecue sauce. Be sure to save some of the sauce for later.&lt;br&gt;
Grill the ribs on the hot barbecue for 2 to 4 minutes per side, or&lt;br&gt;just until you see several spots of charred sauce. Watch for flames&lt;br&gt;and do not burn.&lt;br&gt;
When the ribs are done, use a sharp knife to slice the meat between&lt;br&gt;each bone about halfway down. This will make it easier to tear the&lt;br&gt;ribs apart when they are served. Serve the ribs piping hot with&lt;br&gt;additional sauce on the side, if desired.&lt;br&gt;
Sauce: Combine all of the ingredients in a saucepan over high heat.&lt;br&gt;Use a whisk to blend the ingredients until smooth. When the mixture&lt;br&gt;comes to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer uncovered. In 30 to 45&lt;br&gt;minutes, when the mixture thickens, remove it from the heat. If you&lt;br&gt;want a thicker sauce, heat it longer.  If you make the sauce too&lt;br&gt;thick, thin it with more vinegar.&lt;br&gt;

Bake for 9 minutes,&lt;br&gt;or until edges are light brown. Note: Do not exceed baking time even&lt;br&gt;if they look underbaked. Finished product should be soft in the&lt;br&gt;middle and crunchy around the edges. Variations:  Substitute milk&lt;br&gt;chocolate for the semisweet and/or add 1-1/2 cups of chopped walnuts&lt;br&gt;or macadamia nuts to the recipe before baking. For the best cookie,&lt;br&gt;don't substitute margarine for the butter.&lt;br&gt;

You may also melt them in a microwave oven set on high for 2&lt;br&gt;minutes, stirring halfway through the heating time.&lt;br&gt;When the dough is cool, spread half of the melted chocolate over the&lt;br&gt;surface.  Cool in the refrigerator for 20-30 minutes, or until&lt;br&gt;hardened. Spread the peanut butter mixture evenly over the surface of&lt;br&gt;the chocolate.&lt;br&gt;
Spread the remaining chocolate over the peanut butter, covering to&lt;br&gt;the edges of the pan.  Cool the finished product in the refrigerator&lt;br&gt;or let it sit at room temperature until hardened.  Slice into five&lt;br&gt;even rows and then once down the middle.&lt;br&gt;

Preheat 6-8 cups of oil in a deep fryer to 350 degrees.  &lt;br&gt;Combine the pepper sauce and water in a small bowl.  &lt;br&gt;Combine the flour, salt, cayenne pepper, black pepper, onion powder,&lt;br&gt;paprika and garlic powder in another shallow bowl.    &lt;br&gt;
Pound each of the chicken pieces with a mallet until about 3/8-inch &lt;br&gt;thick.  Trim each breast fillet if necessary to help it fit on the bun.    &lt;br&gt;Working with one fillet at a time, coat each piece with the flour, &lt;br&gt;then dredge it in the diluted pepper sauce.  Coat the chicken once &lt;br&gt;again in the flour mixture and set it aside until the rest of the chicken &lt;br&gt;is breaded. Fry the chicken fillets for 8-12 minutes or until they are &lt;br&gt;light brown and crispy.  Remove the chicken to a rack or to paper &lt;br&gt;towels to drain.  8.

Spread about 2 teaspoons of mayonnaise on the face of each of the&lt;br&gt;inverted top buns. Place a tomato slice onto the mayonnaise, then stack a&lt;br&gt;leaf of lettuce on top of the tomato. On each of the bottom buns,&lt;br&gt;stack one piece of chicken.  Flip the top half of each sandwich onto the&lt;br&gt;bottom half and serve hot.   &lt;br&gt;
